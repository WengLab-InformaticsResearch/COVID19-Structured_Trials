NCT04482699,2020-11-30,Not yet recruiting,Phase 1/Phase 2,Interventional,RAPA-501-Allo Off-the-Shelf Therapy of COVID-19,"Phase I/Phase II Trial of Off-the-Shelf Allogeneic Hybrid TREG/Th2 Cell (RAPA-501-ALLO) Therapy for Severe, Post-Intubation Stage 3 COVID-19 Disease",Severe COVID-19 Disease,Placebo;RAPA-501-Allo off-the-shelf Therapy of COVID-19,All,18,,No,07601,Treatment,Randomized,Sequential Assignment,,Double,"       The first-in-human Phase 1 study component will evaluate two dose levels of RAPA-501-ALLO off       the shelf cells in patients with post-intubation, stage 3 COVID-19 disease, with key       endpoints of safety, biologic and potential disease-modifying effects. The randomized,       double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b study component will evaluate infusion of RAPA-501       ALLO off the shelf cells or a control infusion, with the primary endpoint assessing whether       RAPA-501 cells reduce 30-day mortality.       The COVID-19 pandemic is a disaster playing out with progressive morbidity and mortality. As       of September 18, 2020, an estimated 30.1 million people have contracted the virus and 945,000       deaths have resulted globally. The United States has the highest totals with an estimated 6.7       million people diagnosed and 198,000 deaths. In stages 1 and 2 of COVID-19, viral propagation       within the patient is predominant. As such, therapeutic interventions focus on immune       molecules (convalescent serum, monoclonal antibodies) and anti-viral medications       (remdesivir). In marked contrast, the most severe and deadly form of COVID-19, stage 3, is       driven not by viral propagation, but by an out-of-control immune response (hyperinflammation)       caused by increases in immune molecules known as cytokines and chemokines. As such,       therapeutic interventions for stage 3 disease focus on anti-inflammatory medications such as       anti-cytokine therapy (anti-IL-6 drugs) or corticosteroid therapy. Unfortunately, such       interventions do not address the full pathogenesis of stage 3 COVID-19, which includes       hyperinflammation due to cytokine storm and chemokine storm, tissue damage,       hypercoagulation, and multi-organ failure (including lung, heart, kidney and brain). The       pulmonary component of stage 3 disease includes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),       which is a final-common-pathway of patient death due to a myriad of conditions, including       pneumonia, sepsis, and trauma. There is a dire need for novel cellular treatments that can       deliver both a broad-based immune modulation effect and a tissue regenerative effect, such as       RAPA-501-ALLO off-the-shelf allogeneic hybrid TREG/Th2 Cells.       The mechanism of fatal pneumonia in experimental murine coronavirus infection is mediated by       innate inflammasome activation, a resultant robust infiltration of inflammatory monocytes and       macrophages, and a subsequent increase in multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.       Importantly, the CD4+ and CD8+ adaptive T cell response to experimental coronavirus infection       can be either curative or disease propagating. Viral-induced pulmonary inflammation has also       been evaluated in non-human primate models, which have confirmed that dysregulated immune       activation during viral pneumonia involves T cell subset imbalance, a downstream       monocyte-derived inflammatory cascade, and resultant epithelial cell injury. In humans,       severity of viral-induced lower respiratory tract infection correlates with increased numbers       of effector memory CD8+ T cells in the airway. As recently reviewed, human coronavirus       infection represents an ongoing battle between virus and host, with the nature of the       response dictating disease cure or alternatively, aggravated lung disease. Evidence exists       that the adaptive immune system contributes to pulmonary inflammation during SARS-associated       Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) disease: that is, bronchoalveolar fluid from such subjects had       increased T cell numbers and increased Th1-associated molecules IL-12, IFN-gamma, and IP-10.       This downstream adaptive T cell-mediated inflammatory response is driven in part by the       SARS-Co-V protein viroporin 3a. Specifically, viroporin molecules activate the NLRP3       inflammasome that links innate-to-adaptive inflammatory responses. Furthermore, both SARS-CoV       and SARS-CoV-2 express an open-reading-frame ORF3a molecule, which also activate the NLRP3       inflammasome.       The nature of immunity during resolution of symptomatic COVID-19 infection has recently been       reported, namely: emergence of antibody-secreting cells and CD4+ T follicular helper cells;       increase in perforin- and granzyme-expressing CD8+ T cells; and relative lack of an increase       in pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In marked contrast, patients with severe       COVID-19 disease had greatly increased plasma levels of cytokines (including IL-2 and       TNF-alpha) and chemokines (including IP-10 and MIP-1-alpha) (Huang et al., Lancet, 2020).       Collectively, these results indicate that pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses       that occur in severe COVID-19 is detrimental and that effective anti-inflammatory approaches       may ultimately prove to be therapeutic. However, as previously detailed, the more advanced       Stage 3 COVID-19 disease is characterized by an ARDS component, and cytokine storm, as such,       novel approaches to treat the COVID-19 viral pneumonia should optimally incorporate both an       anti-inflammatory element and a tissue protection/tissue repair element.       Stage 3 COVID-19 carries an estimated 30-day mortality of over 50% in spite of ICU       utilization, mechanical ventilation, and supportive care therapies to manage ARDS and       multiorgan failure. Narrowly acting targeted anti-inflammatory approaches such as anti-IL-6       therapeutics have not been particularly effective in stage 3 COVID-19 and the broad       anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical approach of corticosteroid therapy, has only modestly       tempered stage 3 disease in some studies. Cell therapy is also being evaluated in stage 3       COVID-19, in particular, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and now, with the current       RAPA-501-ALLO protocol, regulatory T (TREG) cells. TREG therapy has a mechanism of action       that includes a multi-faceted anti-inflammatory effect, which puts TREG therapy at the       forefront of future curative therapy of a wide range of autoimmune and neurodegenerative       diseases, plus transplant complications, such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft       rejection. In addition, TREG therapy can provide a tissue regenerative effect, which places       TREG cell therapy at the lead of novel regenerative medicine efforts to repair a myriad of       tissue-based diseases, such as diseases of the skin, muscle, lung, liver, intestine, heart       (myocardial infarction) and brain (stroke). RAPA-501-ALLO off-the-shelf cell therapy offers       this potential dual threat mechanism of action that incorporates both anti-inflammatory and       tissue repair effects for effective treatment of COVID-19 and multiple lethal conditions.       RAPA-501-ALLO cells are generated from healthy volunteers, cryopreserved, banked, and are       then available for off-the-shelf therapy anytime. During manufacturing, T cells are       reprogrammed ex vivo using a novel, patented 7-day two-step process that involves T cell       de-differentiation and subsequent re-differentiation towards the two key anti-inflammatory       programs, the TREG and Th2 pathways, thus creating a hybrid product. The hybrid phenotype       inhibits inflammatory pathways operational in COVID-19, including modulation of multiple       cytokines and chemokines, which attract inflammatory cells into tissue for initiation of       multi-organ damage. The hybrid TREG and Th2 phenotype of RAPA-501-ALLO cells cross-regulates       Th1 and Th17 populations that initiate hyperinflammation of COVID-19. RAPA-501 immune       modulation occurs in a T cell receptor independent manner, thus permitting off-the-shelf cell       therapy. Finally, in experimental models of viral pneumonia and ARDS, TREG cells mediate a       protective effect on the lung alveolar tissue. Because of this unique mechanism of action       that involves both anti-inflammatory and tissue protective effects, the allogeneic RAPA-501 T       cell product is particularly suited for evaluation in the setting of post-intubation, Stage 3       COVID-19.       In general, classical autoimmune disease, neurodegenerative disease, and viral-induced       inflammatory disease are driven by predominance of Th1/Th17-type responses with a relative       insufficiency of the counter-regulatory immune suppressive Th2 and TREG subsets. TREG cells,       which are defined in part by their expression of FOXP3 transcription factor, have been       extensively studied in experimental models for their capacity to modulate autoimmune disease,       neurodegenerative disease, and transplantation complications, including graft-versus-host       disease (GVHD) and graft rejection. Importantly, T cell production of IL-2 or exogenous IL-2       administration drives lung inflammation during experimental viral infection; therefore, given       the known role of TREG cells as a consumer of IL-2, there is a strong mechanistic rationale       for a beneficial contribution of TREG cells during viral-driven lung inflammation.       Furthermore, in an experimental murine models of virus-induced lung inflammation and lung       injury, interventions that augmented TREG cell number and function accelerated the repair of       lung injury. And, Th2 cells, which are defined in part by their expression of GATA3       transcription factor, were described thirty years ago as a powerful counter-regulatory       population to prevent Th1 cell predominance. It is important to note that clinical data       indicates that maneuvers that increase immune suppressive cell populations, including TREG       cells, can reduce severe inflammatory disease such as graft-versus-host disease without       impairing anti-viral immunity. In addition, in both experimental models and clinical studies,       an appropriate level of TREG cells can result in an overall improvement in pulmonary       inflammation during viral bronchiolitis. Collectively, these findings indicate that T cells       expressing a combined TREG/Th2 phenotype would predictably yield beneficial effects in the       setting of viral-induced pulmonary inflammation and injury associated with severe Stage 3       COVID-19 disease.       Clinical trials have evaluated both TREG and Th2-type cells for various conditions, most       prominently transplantation complications. In general, thymic-derived natural (n)TREG cells       are thought to express a more stable phenotype than post-thymic induced (i)TREG cells; by       comparison, iTREG cells can mediate more potent suppression. Nonetheless, both nTREG and       iTREG cells are susceptible to differentiation plasticity, which creates concern that a       potentially therapeutic TREG population might convert to pathogenic Th1/Th17 phenotypes in       vivo. Ex vivo expanded (n)TREG cells were evaluated in the setting of allogeneic       hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using cord blood donors; more recently, the same       research group has developed ex vivo expanded (i)TREG cell therapy to limit transplant       complications. In addition, ex vivo expanded nTREG cells have been evaluated in the setting       of type I diabetes mellitus; this clinical trial found that TREG therapy was safe and at       least transiently effective in improving disease control. Furthermore, in the setting of       amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is a disease propagated by a severe Th1-driven       peripheral and central inflammatory response, a clinical trial of nTREG cell adoptive       transfer identified that the intervention was safe and showed promise in terms of ALS disease       amelioration. Finally, in a phase II study of rapamycin-resistant Th2 cell therapy in the       setting of low-intensity allogeneic HCT, adoptive Th2 cell transfer was safe and associated       with a shift towards Th2 polarization in vivo, preservation of donor engraftment,       stabilization of mixed chimerism, a low rate of GVHD, and potent anti-tumor effects in       patients with refractory hematologic malignancy. Collectively, these clinical trial results       indicate that the adoptive transfer of TREG and Th2-type populations can be safely       administered, even in the allogeneic HCT setting, and can mediate beneficial modulation of       inflammatory conditions.       Ex vivo manufacturing can be utilized to generate induced (i)TREG cells from the post-thymic       pool of peripheral T cells. In the current protocol, the manufacturing method will focus upon       mTOR inhibition, which is an established intervention that promotes the induction of TREG       cells. In combination with mTOR inhibition, the culture system that is utilized incorporates       cytokines that promote both a Th2 and a TREG phenotype, namely, IL-4, TGF-beta, and IL-2.       Finally, the protocol will include a TREG/Th2 cell product comprised of both CD4+ and CD8+ T       cell subsets, as these counter-regulatory T cell subsets express differential T cell receptor       (TCR) repertoires and a diversity of effector mechanisms that can potentially enhance an       anti-inflammatory effect. For RAPA-501 manufacture, peripheral blood mononuclear cells are       collected from a steady-state apheresis and subjected to the following two-step culture       intervention: in step 1, a severe starvation step results in T cell de-differentiation, which       is realized through both selective media utilization and the addition of FDA-approved       pharmaceutical agents that potently inhibit mTOR signaling; and in step 2, re-differentiation       of T cells occurs using co-stimulation agents and Th2- and TREG-type polarizing cytokines.       After 6-days in culture, the resultant TREG/Th2 population is cryopreserved in single-use       aliquots at protocol-driven therapeutic doses. T cells of type II cytokine phenotype are       characterized in part by their expression of the transcription factor GATA3 whereas       regulatory T cell populations are identified in part by their expression of FOXP3       transcription factor. At culture initiation, a very low frequency of T cells express either       GATA3 or FOXP3. In contrast, the RAPA-501 cell product manufactured in the TREG/Th2 culture       conditions expresses a high frequency of T cells that are either single-positive for GATA3,       single-positive for FOXP3, or double-positive for both GATA3 and FOXP3. Importantly, this       transcription factor profile is expressed in both manufactured CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. It is       important to note that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations with TREG function have been       defined, including a CD8+ TREG population that potently suppresses GVHD; it is potentially       advantageous to have both subsets represented in a therapeutic product because CD4+ and CD8+       TREG cells utilize differential effector mechanisms.       Regulatory T cell populations can suppress pathogenic effector T cell populations by several       defined mechanisms, including through expression of CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidase molecules,       which act to hydrolyse pro-inflammatory ATP towards the immune suppressive adenosine       substrate . Indeed, TREG cells that express CD39 possess increased suppressive function and       have been associated with resolution of inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore, suppressive       function of human TREG cells is mediated in part by CD73. T cells manufactured in the       TREG/Th2 culture condition have an increase in expression of the TREG-associated effector       molecules, CD39 and CD73. In addition to the CD39/CD73 ectonucleotidases, TREG cell function       has also been correlated with expression of CD103, which is an integrin that dictates       epithelial lymphocyte localization. Indeed, CD103 and IL-2 receptor signaling cooperate to       maintain immune tolerance in the gut mucosa; furthermore, CD103-expressing TREG cells are       critical for amelioration of experimental chronic GVHD . T cells manufactured in the TREG/Th2       culture condition have increased expression of the TREG effector molecule CD103.       In experimental models, the efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy is dependent upon successful       engraftment and in vivo T cell persistence. Importantly, the T cell differentiation state       helps dictate in vivo persistence, with less differentiated cells having increased       persistence. Murine rapamycin-resistant T cells, which expressed a T central memory (TCM)       phenotype, had increased in vivo engraftment potential relative to control T cells. In       addition, human rapamycin-resistant T cells also had increased engraftment in a       human-into-murine model of xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease. T cells with reduced       differentiation relative to the T effector memory (TEM) population have increased in vivo       persistence and mediate increased in vivo effects, including the TCM subset, the naïve T cell       subset, and more recently, the T stem cell memory (TSCM) subset. This relationship between T       cell differentiation status and in vivo T cell function is relevant to TREG cells, as: (1)       TREG cells of TCM phenotype were more effective at reducing experimental GVHD relative to       TREG cells of TEM phenotype; and (2) TREG cells that expressed the stem cell marker CD150       were highly effective for the prevention of stem cell graft rejection. T cells manufactured       in the TREG/Th2 culture condition are enriched for cells having a reduced differentiation       state consistent with a T stem cell subset, including expression of the CD150 marker.       It is also important to assess the cytokine secretion profile of the manufactured RAPA-501       cells. First, it is critical that the cell product is capable of IL-4 secretion, which is the       driver cytokine for subsequent Th2 differentiation. Second, it is desirable that an       adoptively transferred T cell population is capable of secreting IL-2, as this capacity       indicates a progenitor function that permits T cells to expand more readily in vivo without       the need for exogenous IL-2 . Finally, it is important that the RAPA-501 cell population has       reduced secretion of the Th1- or Th17-type cytokines IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-17, and GM-CSF.       The manufactured RAPA-501 cell product secretes IL-4 and IL-2 with minimal secretion of Th1-       or Th17-type cytokines.       Regulatory T cells can also be defined in part by their ability to suppress the proliferation       or function of effector T cells. Importantly, manufactured TREG/Th2 cells potently suppress       Th1/Tc1 cell secretion of multiple inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, and       TNF-alpha. To assess the mechanism of suppression, experiments were performed using the       transwell assay, whereby effector T cells and RAPA-501 cells are separated by a filter that       prevents cell-to-cell contact but allows cell communication by small soluble mediators such       as cytokines. RAPA-501 cells acted in a TCR-independent manner to suppress the cytokine       secretion capacity of effector T cells. Because no co-stimulation was provided to the       transwell chamber containing RAPA-501 cells, RAPA-501 cells did not require co-stimulation to       modulate inflammatory cytokine levels, including IL-2, IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, and TNF-alpha. The       following cytokines and chemokines were reduced by RAPA-501 cells in this transwell assay,       with relatively equal suppression mediated by CD4+ and CD8+ subsets of RAPA-501 cells: CCL1,       CCL2, CCL7, CCL11, CCL13, CCL17, CCL20, CCL22, CCL26, CXCL1, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL12, IL-6,       IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, and IL-10. The ability of TREG cells to consume IL-2 is a commonly       described phenomenon, although previous studies identified the requirement of cell-to-cell       contact for IL-2 consumption. As such, RAPA-501 cells are uniquely capable of modulating the       level of multiple inflammatory cytokines in a contact-independent manner. These results       suggest that RAPA-501 cells represent a suitable candidate for neutralization of multiple       cytokines and chemokines associated with various diseases, including viral-induced lung       inflammation. In light of this capacity of the RAPA-501 cell product to suppress T       cell-mediated inflammation in a TCR-independent manner, RAPA-501 therapy is highly suitable       for allogeneic, off-the-shelf treatment applications.       Further experiments were performed to evaluate whether the RAPA-501 cell product might also       regulate human CNS microglial cells, which are myeloid-derived cells that are analogous to       the peripheral monocyte population. To evaluate whether the RAPA-501 cell product might       modulate pro-inflammatory microglial cells in a contact-independent manner, the ability of       RAPA-501 cells to reduce the inflammatory state of the microglial cell line HMC3 was tested       in a transwell assay. RAPA-501 cells reduced the HMC3 cell secretion of the pro-inflammatory       cytokines IL-6 and IFN-gamma and the pro-inflammatory chemokine IP-10 at the relatively low       ratio of RAPA-501 cells to microglial cells of 1:40. These results demonstrate that the       RAPA-501 product is capable of inhibiting cytokine and chemokine secretion from       myeloid-derived populations in a contact- and TCR-independent manner, thereby providing a       further rationale for allogeneic, off-the-shelf utilization of the RAPA-501 product.       RAPA-501 cell product for stability of T cell phenotype was also evaluated. That is, it has       been determined that a limiting factor of TREG cell therapy may be differentiation       plasticity, for example, whereby TREG cells can be influenced by inflammatory cytokines to       lose their TREG characteristics and adopt a Th1-type inflammatory state, which may then       promote disease pathogenesis. To address this possibility, the RAPA-501 cell capacity to       modulate T cell differentiation transcription factors after an extended culture interval that       involved T cell co-stimulation, the absence of mTOR inhibitors, and the presence of the       polarizing inflammatory cytokines IFN-alpha and IL-6 was studied. These experiments       demonstrated that the RAPA-501 cell product had remarkable differentiation stability       (continued expression of FOXP3 and GATA3 in CD4+ and CD8+ subsets; lack of up-regulation of       TBET).       In summary, RAPA-501 cells express a phenotype consistent with a regulatory T cell       population, including: stable expression of the TREG and Th2 transcription factors FOXP3 and       GATA3; expression of the TREG functional molecules CD39, CD73, and CD103; expression of a       reduced state of T cell differentiation, including expression of the stem cell marker CD150;       secretion of a Th2 pattern of cytokines with minimal secretion of Th1/Th17-type cytokines;       functional suppressive capacity against both effector Th1/Tc1 cells and pro-inflammatory       myeloid cells, including reduced levels of multiple inflammatory cytokines and chemokines;       and a capacity to inhibit inflammatory effectors in a contact- and TCR-independent manner.       Collectively, these characteristics of the RAPA-501 product predicts that this therapy       represents a novel and promising candidate to treat severe COVID-19 disease.       This is a first-in-human phase 1/phase 2b study evaluating allogeneic RAPA-501 cell therapy       in participants with severe, post-intubation Stage 3 COVID-19 disease. Two phase 1 cohorts       will be evaluated, namely, a low-dose Cohort 1 (40 x 10^6 cells/infusion) and a high-dose       Cohort 2 (160 x 10^6 cells/infusion); this phase 1 component will utilize       dose-limiting-toxicity (DLT) as a primary endpoint. Provided that safety is demonstrated in       the phase 1 study component, each RAPA-501 dose cohort can be evaluated in the randomized       phase 2b component. In the phase 2b component, for each RAPA-501 dose level determined to be       safe, patients will be randomized to receive RAPA-501 cells (n=19) or placebo (n=19). After       infusion of either RAPA-501 cells or placebo, these randomized cohorts will continue on       standard-of-care therapy (not protocol-driven). The primary endpoint of the phase 2b study is       30-day mortality, with the statistical goal of reducing mortality in RAPA-501 recipients       relative to the randomized, placebo-control cohort.       Study participants must be hospitalized patients with severe, post-intubation Stage 3       COVID-19 disease, specifically: SARS-CoV-2 infection, as determined by RT-PCR or equivalent       test; pulmonary infiltrate on radiologic examination; and respiratory insufficiency that       required intubation and mechanical ventilation initiated within 4 days prior to RAPA-501       therapy. The study consists of: (1) a study enrollment step (screening); and (2) after       eligibility is confirmed, infusion of RAPA-501 cells will be performed. On Cohort 1, infusion       of RAPA-501 cells will be at a dose of 40 x 10^6 cells/infusion; three participants will be       initially treated, with one week separating participants in this phase 1 component to       evaluate for DLT, which will be defined as grade 3 or greater toxicity attributable to       RAPA-501 cells within 7-days of infusion. At any point that Cohort 1 therapy is deemed to be       safe (either 0/3 or 1/6 having a DLT), then Cohort 1 RAPA-501 therapy can be evaluated in the       randomized phase 2b study component to address the primary study objective relating to 30-day       mortality. At any point that Cohort 1 therapy is deemed to be safe, treatment on Cohort 2 can       be initiated, which will evaluate the infusion of RAPA-501 cells at a dose of 160 x 10^6       cells/infusion. In the same manner as Cohort 1, if Cohort 2 therapy is deemed to be safe,       Cohort 2 RAPA-501 therapy can be evaluated in the randomized phase 2b study component to       address the primary study objective relating to 30-day mortality. The study will be comprised       of three main stages: (1) the above-detailed 30-day interval relating to the primary study       objectives; (2) an extended, total 90-day interval to continue relatively intensive clinical       monitoring of potential efficacy and safety endpoints; and (3) an extended, total 6-month       interval to provide long-term clinical follow-up and to continue to monitor for laboratory       parameters relating to immune and viral endpoints.     ","       The first-in-human Phase 1 study component will evaluate two dose levels of RAPA-501-ALLO off       the shelf cells in patients with post-intubation, stage 3 COVID-19 disease, with key       endpoints of safety, biologic and potential disease-modifying effects. The randomized,       double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b study component will evaluate infusion of RAPA-501       ALLO off the shelf cells or a control infusion, with the primary endpoint assessing whether       RAPA-501 cells reduce 30-day mortality.       The COVID-19 pandemic is a disaster playing out with progressive morbidity and mortality. As       of September 18, 2020, an estimated 30.1 million people have contracted the virus and 945,000       deaths have resulted globally. The United States has the highest totals with an estimated 6.7       million people diagnosed and 198,000 deaths. In stages 1 and 2 of COVID-19, viral propagation       within the patient is predominant. As such, therapeutic interventions focus on immune       molecules (convalescent serum, monoclonal antibodies) and anti-viral medications       (remdesivir). In marked contrast, the most severe and deadly form of COVID-19, stage 3, is       driven not by viral propagation, but by an out-of-control immune response (hyperinflammation)       caused by increases in immune molecules known as cytokines and chemokines. As such,       therapeutic interventions for stage 3 disease focus on anti-inflammatory medications such as       anti-cytokine therapy (anti-IL-6 drugs) or corticosteroid therapy. Unfortunately, such       interventions do not address the full pathogenesis of stage 3 COVID-19, which includes       hyperinflammation due to cytokine storm and chemokine storm, tissue damage,       hypercoagulation, and multi-organ failure (including lung, heart, kidney and brain). The       pulmonary component of stage 3 disease includes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),       which is a final-common-pathway of patient death due to a myriad of conditions, including       pneumonia, sepsis, and trauma. There is a dire need for novel cellular treatments that can       deliver both a broad-based immune modulation effect and a tissue regenerative effect, such as       RAPA-501-ALLO off-the-shelf allogeneic hybrid TREG/Th2 Cells.       Stage 3 COVID-19 carries an estimated 30-day mortality of over 50% in spite of ICU       utilization, mechanical ventilation, and supportive care therapies to manage ARDS and       multiorgan failure. Narrowly acting targeted anti-inflammatory approaches such as anti-IL-6       therapeutics have not been particularly effective in stage 3 COVID-19 and the broad       anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical approach of corticosteroid therapy, has only modestly       tempered stage 3 disease in some studies. Cell therapy is also being evaluated in stage 3       COVID-19, in particular, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and now, with the current       RAPA-501-ALLO protocol, regulatory T (TREG) cells. TREG therapy has a mechanism of action       that includes a multi-faceted anti-inflammatory effect, which puts TREG therapy at the       forefront of future curative therapy of a wide range of autoimmune and neurodegenerative       diseases, plus transplant complications, such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft       rejection. In addition, TREG therapy can provide a tissue regenerative effect, which places       TREG cell therapy at the lead of novel regenerative medicine efforts to repair a myriad of       tissue-based diseases, such as diseases of the skin, muscle, lung, liver, intestine, heart       (myocardial infarction) and brain (stroke). RAPA-501-ALLO off-the-shelf cell therapy offers       this potential dual threat mechanism of action that incorporates both anti-inflammatory and       tissue repair effects for effective treatment of COVID-19 and multiple lethal conditions.       RAPA-501-ALLO cells are generated from healthy volunteers, cryopreserved, banked, and are       then available for off-the-shelf therapy anytime. During manufacturing, T cells are       reprogrammed ex vivo using a novel, patented 7-day two-step process that involves T cell       de-differentiation and subsequent re-differentiation towards the two key anti-inflammatory       programs, the TREG and Th2 pathways, thus creating a hybrid product. The hybrid phenotype       inhibits inflammatory pathways operational in COVID-19, including modulation of multiple       cytokines and chemokines, which attract inflammatory cells into tissue for initiation of       multi-organ damage. The hybrid TREG and Th2 phenotype of RAPA-501-ALLO cells cross-regulates       Th1 and Th17 populations that initiate hyperinflammation of COVID-19. RAPA-501 immune       modulation occurs in a T cell receptor independent manner, thus permitting off-the-shelf cell       therapy. Finally, in experimental models of viral pneumonia and ARDS, TREG cells mediate a       protective effect on the lung alveolar tissue. Because of this unique mechanism of action       that involves both anti-inflammatory and tissue protective effects, the allogeneic RAPA-501 T       cell product is particularly suited for evaluation in the setting of post-intubation, Stage 3       COVID-19.

Baseline values for aPTT and       complete blood count will be obtained from six subjects. Heparin will be administered in       increasing concentrations using one 0.1 mL(millilitre) spray per nostril (0.2 ml total) on a       daily basis. Major signs of toxicity will be clinically relevant changes in aPTT time,       clinically relevant decrease in platelet count, signs of anosmia 30 minutes after       administration, or epistaxis. Dosing will start at 1000 units of heparin administered (500       units in each nostril) and then escalated to 2000 units. Should a clinically relevant aPTT       prolongation (>50% increase from subject baseline) or decrease in platelet count (below       clinical lab normal limit) be observed at either dose, the study will be halted and a series       of lower doses evaluated.       Study Overview       Description of Design of Study       This study is a single center, prospective, Phase 0 exploratory tolerability trial. A total       of 6 healthy subjects (3 M and 3 F) will be enrolled into the study. This study will evaluate       the acute and multi-day (14 days) tolerability of intranasally administered heparin.       Test Article       Investigational Product       The study will assess the single and multi-dose tolerability of intranasal administration of       an aliquot of an FDA-approved heparin sodium injection (5,000 USP units/mL or 10,000 USP       units/mL) to deliver 1000U (units) or 2000U of heparin sodium. Doses will be prepared and       administered as follows:       1000 U = (2 x 0.1 mL(milliliter) of 5000U(units)/mL or one spray of 500 U in each nostril)       2000 U = (2 x 0.1 mL of 10000U/mL or one spray of 1000 U in each nostril)       The test article will be administered by transferring (4 mL) of sterile heparin sodium       injection (5,000 USP units/mL or 10,000 USP units/mL) at ambient room temperature into       intranasal spray bottles, one for each individual subject.       The test article will be administered within 4 weeks of preparation, and the remainder       discarded after study completion.       Supplier The test article (Heparin Sodium USP) will be obtained from appropriate commercial       sources.       Safety Assessments       Safety assessments will be completed as part of this single and multi-dose, pharmacokinetic       study. Safety will be assessed prior to test article administration and at 24 post dose, in       the acute phase. For safety assessments during the chronic phase, safety assessments will be       assessed prior to test article administration , day 14 and day 15-post study. Test subject       will be called every three (3) days for updates and subjective reports (adverse events),       during 14 day, daily dose phase. Subject safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse       events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and physical examinations.       Laboratory parameters will be evaluated during screening and daily, to include the following:         -  Complete Blood Count (WBC, RBC(red blood cell count), Hematocrit, Hemoglobin, MCV (mean            corpuscular volume), Platelet Count)         -  PT(prothrombin time)/INR (international normalized ratio) Baseline and post study         -  Serum/Urine hCG ( human chorionic gonadotropin)baseline and predose         -  Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT)       Clinical Adverse Events       Clinical Adverse Events will be monitored throughout the study. However, such events are not       anticipated during this trial due to the low systemic exposure of the test article being       administered. However, local side effects of intranasal heparin, such as epistaxis or nasal       congestion may result.       For any abnormal lab values, test subjects will be evaluated for any sign and symptoms, and       labs will be redrawn, until stabilized or returned to baseline. Subjects will be referred to       the primary physician for any continued care required.     ","       The investigators are investigating the tolerability of Heparin Sodium (porcine) administered       topically via a nasal spray. This agent is being investigated as a potential prophylactic       treatment to prevent infection by SARS(severe acute respiratory syndrome)-CoV-2, the novel       coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Heparin Sodium (porcine) is an FDA-approved anticoagulant       drug administered by injection. Recent work from multiple groups have found that heparin can       prevent the infection of cells by SARS-CoV-2, indicating a possible use as a topical       anti-viral. Numerous studies in both rodent models and humans have shown that heparin       administered via a pulmonary or intranasal route enters the blood stream in negligible       amounts, suggesting intranasal administration of heparin should be safe even at very large       doses. Data from mouse models indicate that repeated daily nasal administration of heparin       had no adverse effects in mice over a two week period (including weight loss, nose bleeds,       loss of sense of smell, nasal discharge, or decreased blood clotting time). However, no data       of repeated nasal administration of heparin in humans is available.       The investigators will test nasal administration of FDA-approved heparin sodium (porcine),       originally formulated for injection. The formulations the investigators will be testing       consist of heparin, sodium chloride, and 1% benzyl alcohol as a preservative bottled in a       nasal sprayer dispensing 0.1 mL(millilitres) per spray. The investigation is planned in two       phases. A single-dose phase will test the acute tolerability of the drug. In this phase,       subjects will be administered 0.1 mL of Heparin Sodium in each nostril formulated at one of       two doses: Day 1 will test a formulation of 5000 U(units)/mL, and Day 2 will test a       formulation of 10000 U(units) /mL. After each dose, subjects will be tested for systemic       exposure via blood aPTT tests and platelet count, as well as for local topical toxicity via       examination for epistaxis and anosmia, along with any other adverse events. In the chronic       phase, subjects will be administered the highest dose that was tolerated in the acute phase       daily for fourteen days. Subjects will be tested for aPTT and platelet count, as well as       epistaxis, anosmia and any other adverse events.

In one multicenter European study, 85.6%       of patients with mild to moderate symptoms reported hyposmia or anosmia with early recovery       of olfactory function in just under half of patients. However, the pathogenesis and natural       history of COVID-19 related olfactory dysfunction is poorly understood.       Anosmia most commonly arises in association with sinonasal disease or post-infectious or       post-traumatic disorders. Notably, olfactory loss has been associated with impaired quality       of life, higher rates of depression, and even increased mortality risk. Spontaneous recovery       has been observed in patients with post- infectious olfactory dysfunction, typically over a       period of months to years, with an estimated one-third of patients demonstrating meaningful       improvement after one year.       Smell retraining therapy appears to be an effective therapeutic option for patients with       post-infectious olfactory dysfunction, particularly for patients who initiate treatment       within one year from onset of symptoms, but requires an intervention period of at least three       to four months. Various pharmacotherapies have been investigated in the treatment of       post-infectious anosmia but none have clearly demonstrated utility with the exception of a       possible benefit for nasal steroid irrigations in combination with smell retraining therapy.       More recently, omega-3 polyunsaturated fat supplementation has emerged as a promising       pharmacotherapy for olfactory dysfunction in patients without sinonasal disease. Omega-3       fatty acid deficient mice demonstrate evidence of olfactory dysfunction and mice receiving       omega-3 fatty acids have improved recovery after peripheral nerve injury, which has been       linked to neuroprotective effects mediated through anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory       pathways. In humans, a large cross-sectional study found that older adults with higher       dietary fat intake had lower incidence of olfactory impairment. From a clinical perspective,       patients without sinonasal disease receiving postoperative omega-3 fatty acid supplementation       after endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery in a randomized control trial demonstrated a       significantly greater rate of return of normal olfactory dysfunction.       Little is known about either the natural history of olfactory dysfunction associated with       COVID-19 infection or about the therapeutic efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in       patients with post-viral anosmia. The study team hopes to gain a better understanding of each       through a randomized double-blind placebo control study that assesses both objective and       subjective perception of olfactory dysfunction over a period of 6 weeks after infection.

Patients with this viral infection are       at risk for developing pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).       Approximately 20% to 30% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia require       intensive care for respiratory support. Clinically, ARDS presents with severe hypoxemia       evolving over several days to a week in combination with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on       chest X-ray. Widespread alveolar epithelial cell and pulmonary capillary endothelial injury       can lead to severe impairment in gas exchange. In one report of 1,099 patients hospitalized       with COVID-19, ARDS occurred in 15.6% of patients with severe pneumonia. In a smaller case       series of 138 hospitalized patients, ARDS occurred in 19.6% of patients and in 61.1% of       patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU).       To date, no effective treatment has been established to treat COVID-19 or to prevent       progression of ARDS. It is thought that a heightened immune response with an unbalanced       release of inflammatory mediators in the airway is a major cause of morbidity and mortality       associated with the disease. It is therefore reasonable to postulate that improved outcomes       may be obtained in patients with a balanced immune response with adequate viral control and       appropriate counter-regulatory immune responses whereas a poor outcome may be expected in       patients with inadequate viral control or a heightened immune response or what is referred to       as a cytokine storm. Thus, modulating the pulmonary immune response without suppressing the       immune system would be a viable strategy for patients with COVID-19. The current literature       supports the role of neuromodulation, particularly vagal nerve stimulation (VNS), in       modulating the immune response. Modulating the pro-inflammatory pathway through VNS has been       demonstrated to decrease inflammatory mediators and improve outcomes in several animal models       and in humans.       Percutaneous electrical nerve field stimulation (PENFS) provides a novel, non-invasive method       of VNS through a non-implantable device applied to the external ear. Already, the FDA has       cleared this technology for reducing symptoms of opioid withdrawal in patients with opioid       use disorder. Symptoms of opioid withdrawal can be decreased by approximately 90% after 1       hour of stimulation. Similarly, the IB-Stim device has been shown to improve symptom in       children with abdominal-pain-related functional GI disorders and recently received market       approval by the FDA for that indication. Unpublished studies have demonstrated marked       decrease in inflammation with PENFS compared to sham stimulation in a model of TNBS colitis.       While the efficacy of PENFS in modulating the progression of pulmonary disease in patients       with COVID-19 is unknown, several proposed mechanisms for regulation of the immune response       through VNS have already been demonstrated. We propose to perform an open label, randomized       study to evaluate the efficacy of PENFS for the treatment of respiratory symptoms in patients       with COVID-19.

COVID-19 is spreading rapidly throughout the world. While a       proportion of people with COVID-19 have sufficiently severe symptoms to require       hospitalization at the time of initial symptom onset, in others the disease may remain mild,       and in some cases there has been observed a worsening of symptoms a few days after initial       presentation with relatively mild symptoms. There is an urgent need for understanding the       progression of disease for individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 who do not require       immediate hospitalization.       This is an international, observational cohort study of adults with SARS-CoV-2       infection/COVID-19 who have been assessed as not requiring hospitalization (outpatients).       This study will also be a platform for the screening of outpatients for randomized trials       that will be conducted by the INSIGHT group.       Adults who seek testing for SARS-CoV-2 will be screened following consent. Those with       confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection will form an observational cohort study and be followed for 28       days. Procedures and data collection have been streamlined to facilitate the enrollment of a       large number of adults at INSIGHT sites around the world.     ","       The general aim of this study is to estimate the rate of disease progression for adults who       seek testing and test positive for SARS-CoV-2. The primary endpoint for this study and the       basis for sample size is hospitalization or death during the 28 day follow-up period. In some       locations, special facilities are being built/utilized for quarantine/public health reasons       for those who are SARS-Cov-2 positive. Hospitalization is defined as a stay for at least 18       hours, irrespective of reason, at a hospital or one of these special facilities after study       enrollment.

COVID-19 has many similarities to previously seen coronaviruses, such as those       that caused the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) that emerged in 2011 and the       Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003. Based on early reports, many patients       may present with mild to moderate respiratory symptoms, but approximately 20% developed       severe symptoms. These severe cases developed a multitude of life threatening complications,       like acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and shock.       An early investigation into the patients with severe presentations, revealed high levels of       inflammatory cytokines like interleukin 2 (IL-2), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor       alpha (TNF-α), and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1). This upregulation of       inflammatory cytokines, also referred to as a cytokine storm, is similar to the innate immune       response triggered by the previous coronaviruses.5,6 The increased production of these       cytokines is the expected anti-viral response of the innate immune system, which is trigged       by viral RNA replication. Viral replication triggers downstream inflammatory signaling       cascades like NF-κB and IRF3 leading to increased neutrophil and monocyte-macrophages       infiltrating the tissue. While effective against viral infection, this process is also       believed to be responsible for the development of the significant respiratory complications       associated with COVID-19.       ALI and ARDS are not unique to COVID-19 and develop with many viral respiratory infections.       Several therapeutic strategies have been evaluated in ALI and ARDS and demonstrated benefit       outside of the current pandemic. Heparin, a commonly used anticoagulant, has been shown to       exhibit anti-inflammatory properties within the respiratory system. An in vitro study of       heparin in a pulmonary cell model of ALI found that heparin significantly inhibited the NF-κB       pathway. This inhibition led to a reduced levels of IL-6 and TNF-α in human alveolar       macrophages exposed to an E. coli lipopolysaccharide to simulate inflammatory ALI.       Additionally, heparin significantly reduced IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1 in human alveolar type II       cell models. No increases in necrosis or apoptosis were observed.       In addition to these immunomodulation effects, heparin is primarily an anticoagulant and       systemic administration carries a risk of bleeding. Due to this, several investigations were       conducted in animal models and in humans to determine if administering the heparin via       nebulization could take advantage of the immunomodulation, without increasing the risk of       bleeding. Nebulized heparin was studied in a rat model of ARDS and was observed to attenuate       ALI through reduction of pro-coagulant and pro-inflammatory pathways. Significant reductions       in IL-6 and TNF-α were observed. Additionally, reductions in the expression of NF-κB were       observed in the alveolar macrophages.       Several clinical investigations in humans with ARDS have also been completed. In a       randomized, placebo controlled study of 60 patients with severe ARDS, patients were       randomized to nebulized heparin, streptokinase and placebo. Patients in the heparin group       received 10,000 units via nebulizer every 4 hours and had significant improvements in their       ARDS by day 8. No effect on systemic coagulation markers like APTT and INR were observed.       Additionally, no major bleeding events or blood transfusions were observed. A second,       randomized placebo controlled trial of 50 patients requiring more than 48 hours of mechanical       ventilation was conducted to determine the possible benefit of nebulized heparin. Patients       with ALI that received nebulized heparin had a significant reduction in the time on the       ventilator as compared to placebo. Patients that received heparin had higher APTT values than       those that received placebo, but no significant bleeding events occurred. This study utilized       a heparin dose of 25,000 units every 4 hours, which may explain the difference between the       laboratory effects in the two human studies.       Heparin has demonstrated the ability to reduce the inflammatory cytokines believed to be       responsible for the development of ALI and ARDS in COVID-19 and it may prove to be beneficial       in this patient population. When administered via nebulization, no adverse effects were       observed in the previously conducted studies and may provide a safe therapeutic option to       improve the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 related ALI and ARDS.

First reports from China clearly indicate that older       patients with underlying cardiovascular disease and/or cardiac risk factors demonstrate       higher mortality rates. Most recent reports provided novel insights into the incidence of       myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients and its association with adverse outcomes. In both       studies, patients with myocardial injury manifested by elevated high-sensitivity troponin I       (TnI) levels had significantly higher in-hospital mortality rates compared with those without       myocardial injury, (59.6 and 8.9% (3) and 51 vs 4.5 %). Among patients with myocardial       injury, higher levels of TnI were associated with higher mortality rates. While the highest       mortality rates were observed in patients with elevated TnI and underlying cardiovascular       disease (CVD), mortality rates were also considerable in patients with elevated TnI and       without prior CVD. In contrast, patients with known cardiovascular disease without TnI       elevation had more favorable outcomes. Cardiac injury was independently associated with an       increased risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19. The arming reports clearly indicate       that the data from larger populations from multiple centers are needed to further       characterize and better understand the association between myocardial injury and adverse       outcomes in COVID-19 patients.

Becoming sick with COVID-19 virus or any other serious       respiratory condition is not fun. However, the dramatic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on       human society stem from its significant mortality, not the number of individuals who become       sick. This project aims to prevent serious outcomes such as hospitalization, respiratory       failure and death during the time it takes to develop vaccinations and other strategies to       prevent COVID-19 infectionPoor outcomes with COVID-19 infection such as hospitalization,       respiratory failure, organ failure and death are associated with a dysfunctional exaggerated       immune response, called a cytokine storm, that is triggered by Interleukin-6 expression       (IL-6) and seems to occur around day 5 to 7 of symptoms. Fluoxetine has extraordinarily       strong evidence in its action as a blocker of IL-6 and cytokine storms in both animal models       of infection and in human illness such as rheumatoid arthritis and others. This action of       fluoxetine is an entirely separate pathway than the serotonergic pathway that allows       fluoxetine to act as an antidepressant. This pathway has been demonstrated in cell culture,       in animal models, in human illness and by novel bioinformatics analyses of protein       transcripts to be relatively unique for fluoxetine and appears to be a novel pathway. This       project aims to inhibit the increase in IL-6 expression and thereby prevent the cytokine       storm that causes poor outcomes. Patients who have tested positive or are presumptively       positive for COVID-19 will be entered into the study and given the option to start the       medication fluoxetine, which is demonstrated to prevent IL-6 surges in infectious and       inflammatory conditions. Participants will be monitored daily for COVID-19 symptoms and       weekly for side effects and tolerance of fluoxetine. A subset of patients will have blood       drawn weekly and stored to monitor IL-6 and other cytokine levels at a later date.       This project aims to reduce the serious outcomes of COVID-19 infection by preventing or       inhibiting the cytokine storm associated with organ failure, respiratory failure and death.

This new kind of coronavirus is generating an unprecedented impact both on the       general population and on the healthcare systems in most countries. Health services are       trying to expand their capacity to respond to the pandemic, taking actions such as increasing       the number of beds; acquiring necessary equipment to provide intensive therapy (ventilators),       and calling retired health professionals and health students so they can assist the       overwhelmed health care workforce. Unfortunately, these organizational changes at health       facilities, along with the fears and concerns of becoming ill with the virus or infecting       their families, put an enormous emotional burden on workers in health services which may lead       to negative outcomes on mental health in this population. Based on the literature to date,       Covid-19 is significantly larger than previous pandemics in terms of the number of affected       people worldwide, its spread across countries, its impact on healthcare systems and the       severity of measures that have been taken by governments. Immediate consequences are palpable       in the health care system. Many healthcare workers are overwhelmed by the increased workload;       the lack of supplies and materials to provide appropriate treatment; the lack of clinical       guidelines on prioritization and triage; and the increased feelings of isolation and       loneliness. Previous research indicates that these negative effects can last over time and       lead to the development of serious mental health problems such as post-traumatic stress       disorder.       Recent cross-sectional studies in China indicate that health service workers exposed to       people with Covid-19 reported higher rates of depressive and anxious symptoms. This negative       impact on mental health among health workers in China has also been informally reported in       other countries where the Covid-19 pandemic has been devastating in its effects (such as       Spain and Italy), as well as in countries where the pandemic is becoming a growing public       health problem. This is particularly relevant in regions with fewer resources (Latin America,       North Africa), where there are limited means and the response from the health system is       usually insufficient. Moreover, it is necessary to study these negative effects       longitudinally considering that some effects will appear over time (post-traumatic stress).       Also, it is necessary to take into account the nature and the extent of the health response       (e.g., deployment, increased workload) in order to advance our understanding of these complex       phenomenon and to inform policy and develop the kind of supports that this population deems       useful.       Accordingly, this prospective (0, 3, 6 and 12 months), multisite cohort study aims to       describe, examine, and evaluate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on mental health and       psycho/social factors among workers at health services from Latin America and the Caribbean       (Chile, Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico, Bolivia, and Puerto Rico),       Europe and neighboring countries (Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, Armenia, Poland,       Macedonia, and Turkey), the Middle East and North Africa (Lebanon and Tunisia), as well as       Sub-Saharan Africa (Nigeria, Ghana) and Asia (China).

Duringthe early emergent phases of such diseases, there       is often no vaccine to prevent infection, nor specifictherapeutic agent to treat the disease.       The objective of this protocol is the collection of immune plasma from persons post-recovery       from COVID-19 or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. This plasma may potentially be used in the       treatment or prophylaxis of active COVID-19 under other protocols.       Candidates will be screened for eligibility to participate in plasma donations and their       blood levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Enrolled subjects will receive a baseline physical       and laboratory examination. Subjects with sufficient neutralizing antibody titers who meet       standard blood bank criteria for plasma donation will then be scheduled for plasma       collections. Plasmapheresis is the preferred method of collection, with up to 800 mL of       plasma collected per donation depending on the weight of the donor. Collected immune plasma       will be tested for blood-borne pathogens, and stored according to standard blood bank       procedures. The scope of this protocol is limited to collection of plasma from subjects with       sufficiently high anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titer. Any administration of       convalescent immune plasma to subjects will be performed under a separate protocol.     ","       Background:       The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a major public health issue. Right now,       there is no vaccine to keep people from getting sick. There is also no treatment for people       who do get sick. Researchers want to collect plasma from people who have recovered from       COVID-19. The plasma will have antibodies against the virus that causes COVID-19. If a       vaccine is made, people who develop immunity from the vaccine can also donate plasma.       Objective:       To collect plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19 or have been vaccinated       against the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, so that the plasma can be used to treat people       with the disease.

The evidence from clinical       research trials is sparse and has many flaws. Much of the Chinese experience with Chloroquine       comes from a letter to the editor and a news briefing/conference held on February 15, 2020.       The letter describes experience with more than 100 patients treated with CQ in multicenter       clinical trials but the letter provides no quantitative data to back their claims. At least       one non-randomized clinical trial has been performed in Europe. Covid-19 infected patients       received 10 days of HCQ daily and underwent daily testing of viral loads from nasopharyngeal       swabs. The subjects receiving HCQ were much more likely (P<0.02) to clear their viral load       than subjects who did not receive HCQ. The study had many flaws, which make the conclusions       less valuable than rigorously designed randomized clinical trial.

Coronavirus RNA was quickly identified in these patients.       This novel coronavirus has been designated SARS-CoV-2, and the disease caused by this virus       has been designated COVID-19 and has infected hundreds of thousands of confirmed individuals       in more than 200 countries. Currently there are no approved therapeutic agents available for       coronaviruses. There is an urgent need for an effective treatment to treat symptomatic       patients but also to decrease the duration of virus transmission in the community. Among       candidate drugs to treat COVID-19, repurposing of FDA-approved drugs for use as antiviral       treatments is proposed because knowledge on safety profile, side effects, and drug       interactions are well known.       In silico screening of FDA licensed compound libraries against the SARS CoV 2 protease Plpro       catalytic site was performed using solved crystal structures of the protein. Plpro       (Papain-like protease) is an early acting protease responsible for initial processing of the       SARS CoV2 polyprotein into active subunits. Plpro also has ubiquitinase activity, and is       implicated in early infection phase inhibition of innate (interferon) immune responses which       otherwise would suppress viral replication. A ranked list of licensed compounds with       predicted binding activity in the Plpro catalytic site was computationally generated, and the       Plpro catalytic site binding pose of each of the top compounds was examined and ranked by a       team of pharmaceutical chemists. Package inserts or product monographs for the licensed       compounds which generated high computational binding scores and passed inspection were then       reviewed and used to rank compounds based on adverse events, warnings, drug interactions       on-target mechanisms, pharmacokinetic and absorption, metabolism, excretion and toxicity       (ADMET), protein binding and available therapeutic window considerations. Famotidine       (Pepcid), a histamine H2 antagonist widely available over-the-counter, was repeatedly       computationally scored among the highest of the compounds tested, and was associated with the       most favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile. A series of analogs of famotidine were       generated using PubChem, and many of these scored even higher as potential candidates. This       control compound set further confirmed the predicted binding of the molecular backbone       chemotype at the Plpro protease/ubiquitinase site. Currently available as oral and IV       products, famotidine has a very attractive proven safety, drug interaction, and therapeutic       window profile. Samples of famotidine have been submitted at Southern Research and IITRI for       in vitro testing in COVID-19 cultures. Unpublished anecdotal case studies suggest clinical       benefits associated with administration of famotidine 40 mg PO TID in mild COVID-19       infection.       On 29 April 2020, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) announced       that Remdesivir was better than placebo in reducing time to recovery for people hospitalized       with advanced COVID-19 and lung involvement. In an earlier study of adult patients admitted       to a hospital for severe COVID-19, Remdesivir was not associated with statistically       significant clinical benefits. In that study, Remdesivir was not associated with a difference       in time to clinical improvement. Although not statistically significant, patients receiving       Remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo       among patients with symptom duration of 10 days or less. Remdesivir was stopped early because       of higher numbers of adverse events compared to placebo. Because of these studies the FDA       stated on 1 May 2020, that it is reasonable to believe that known and potential benefits of       Remdesivir outweigh its known and potential risks, in some specific populations hospitalized       with severe COVID-19.       Given the refinement of standard of care to include Remdesivir and no longer       hydroxychloroquine, we have edited the study protocol to reflect this new standard of care.     ","       The overall objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of COVID-19       treatments consisting of standard of care (SOC), vs SOC with high dose famotidine in patients       hospitalized and meeting radiologic criteria for COVID-19 disease. SOC for the treatment for       COVID-19 has evolved since the initial conceptualization of this protocol and early       recruitment of patients. Initially SOC included hydroxychloroquine and has progressed to       include Remdesivir. This protocol is amended to allow the SOC to reflect the prevailing       treatment for COVID-19. We will compare clinical outcomes associated with SOC and the       addition of high-dose intravascular famotidine. The trial is designed to enroll at least 471       COVID-19 patients hospitalized with moderate to severe disease into each of the two treatment       arms, with a total enrollment target of at least 942 patients. This trial has been designed       and powered to support up to three interim analyses that will enable prompt assessment of       benefits and risks of the two treatment groups while maintaining the rigorous gold standard       of a randomized double blind clinical trial structure. Trial design has been guided by       practical consideration of the current clinical context involving rapidly escalating demands       on hospital staff and resources, and incorporates a minimalist approach employing existing       laboratory information management systems and a clinically relevant binary primary outcome of       30-day endpoint of death or survival.

The Pandemic       Research Network (PRN): Duke Community Health Watch study leverages technology, clinical       research, epidemiology, telemedicine, and population health management capabilities to       understand how to safely COVID-19. The target population is individuals in the Duke Health       region as well as individuals beyond the Duke Health region who have flu-like symptoms, a       viral test order for COVID-19, confirmed COVID-19, or concern for exposure to COVID-19. A       subgroup of particular interest within the target population is health care workers (HCW) and       families of HCW. Community members will enroll in the study electronically and for 28 days       will be reminded via email or SMS to submit signs and symptoms related to COVID-19.       Participants who report symptoms will be provided information about COVID-19 testing (if       needed) and established mechanisms to seek care within Duke Health. Instructions for       telemedicine and in-person visits, which is available publicly at       https://www.dukehealth.org/covid-19-update, will be presented to participants. Participants       who are unable to report symptoms independently may be contacted via telephone by Population       Health Management Office (PHMO) or Clinical Events Classification (CEC) team members. Data       collected through the Pandemic Response Network (PRN): Duke Community Health Watch study       will be used for three objectives.         -  First, to characterize the epidemiological features of COVID-19. Specifically, we will            have a high-risk subgroup of HCW and families of HCW that we enroll.         -  Second, to develop models that predict deterioration and the need for inpatient care,            intensive care, and mechanical ventilation.         -  Third, to develop forecast models to estimate the volume of inpatient and outpatient            resources needed to manage a COVID-19 population.       The primary risk to study participants is loss of protected health information. To address       this concern, all data will be stored in Duke''s REDCap instance and the Duke Protected       Analytics Compute Environment (PACE).

Study Design: 10000 patient U.S.-based EHR-guided, retrospective observational cohort       analysis. Data will abstracted through the EHR. Because this is a computer-generated       observational retrospective registry, informed consent will not be practical. Accordingly, we       will ask our Institutional Review Board to waive the requirement for informed consent.

Inpatient OR outpatient management of COVID-19 infection       Patient Enrollment: We will create a search engine query through the EHR to identify patients       with an objective COVID-19 diagnosis who are hospitalized or being treated as outpatients.       This will be executed retrospectively for patients already objectively-diagnosed at       participating clinical sites.       Primary Outcome: 30-day and 90-day frequency of objectively confirmed, adjudicated arterial       thromboembolism or VTE, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).       Secondary Outcome: 30-day and 90-day frequency of adjudicated all-cause death, bleeding, and       thromboembolic outcomes.       Additional Variables of Interest: Additional measured variables will include VTE-related risk       factors, prevention and management patterns, and cause of death. We will review the notes and       diagnostic testing sections of the Electronic Health Record to complete an electronic case       report form for each subject.

","       Novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a major international public health concern.       While much of the morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 has been attributed to       acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or end-organ failure, emerging data suggest that       disorders of coagulation, in particular hypercoagulability and venous thromboembolism (VTE),       may represent an additional major, and possibly preventable, complication (Wu C, et al. JAMA       Intern Med. 2020 Mar 13. [Epub ahead of print] and Tang N, et al. Thromb. Haemost. 2020 Feb       19. [EPub Ahead of Print]). Abnormal coagulation testing results, especially markedly       elevated D-dimer and FDP, have been associated with a poor prognosis in COVID-19 infection.       We propose the following Electronic Health Record (EHR)-guided 10000-patient, retrospective       observational cohort study to assess VTE incidence, risk factors, prevention and management       patterns, and thrombotic outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection. In order to gain the       valuable perspective of other regional and national centers providing care for large       populations of COVID-19, we have started a collaborative network with 5 additional sites       which will provide us with de-identified data from 1000 patients each.

While most       patients recover on their own with basic measures at home, around 20% suffer a more       aggressive disease requiring hospitalization, of which 5% necessitating intensive care unit       (ICU) admission and potential invasive breathing support. The wide spectrum of COVID 19 also       include a significant number of totally asymptomatic patients who are unknowingly spreading       the disease. Human convalescent plasma is an option for treatment of COVID-19 and could be       rapidly available when there are sufficient numbers of people who have recovered and can       donate high titer neutralizing immunoglobulin-containing plasma. This convalescent plasma       could be beneficial, not only for severely ill and intubated patients, but also for those       with moderate disease early in their disease course to prevent further disease progression       and ICU admission.

New strains of viruses may appear and cause epidemics in healthy       persons or immunocompromised persons. A better understanding of these new virus strains may       help to control and prevent these infections. Some viral infections that would otherwise be       asymptomatic or cause mild disease can be life threatening in immunocompromised persons.       Immunocompromised persons often shed high titers of virus for prolonged periods of time. In       the absence of a potent immune system, viruses may evolve more rapidly in their hosts.       Therefore, analysis of sequential virus specimens from these patients can provide information       on virus evolution, including how resistance to antiviral agents can develop. In addition,       higher titers of virus may be associated with virus mutants that are more adapted to grow in       cell culture. In this protocol we will obtain specimens containing viruses from otherwise       healthy or immunocompromised patients over sequential periods of time to study their nucleic       acid sequences, sensitivity to antiviral agents, cell types infected by the virus, and       ability to grow in cell culture. In some cases we weill review tissue biosies or clinical       reports from outside laboratories to assist with the diagnosis of virus-associated diseases.       We will also record the patient s signs and symptoms, note results of any pertinent       laboratory work-up, and in some cases, obtain blood to measure immune responses, isolate       antibodies, or virus-specific T cells, or to look for viremia. This study should provide       further understanding on how viruses evolve in their natural hosts, how they become resistant       to antiviral agents, how antibody responses evolve to viruses, and might allow some currently       uncultivatable viruses to be grown in cell culture.

New strains of viruses may appear and infect both healthy people and       those with weak immune systems. A better understanding of these new virus strains (such as       SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19) may help to control and prevent these infections.       In particular, some viral infections that are less problematic in healthy persons can be life       threatening in persons with weak immune systems, and viruses may be able to evolve more       rapidly in persons with weak immune systems and therefore develop resistance to existing       treatments. Researchers are interested in collecting samples and information from otherwise       healthy persons or persons with weak immune systems to study the effects of viruses and their       development.       Objectives:       - To collect samples and data from individuals who have been exposed to or have contracted       viral infections.       Eligibility:         -  Individuals of all ages who have been diagnosed with a viral infection are suspected to            have a viral infection, or have been in close contact with someone with a suspected or            actual viral infection that is of interest to investigators in the Laboratory of            Infectious Diseases.         -  Healthy persons and persons with weak immune systems (immunocompromised individuals) are            eligible to participate.       Design:         -  Participants will be pre-screened to determine if they meet the eligibility criteria for            the trial.         -  If eligible, evaluation may include a medical chart review, a history and physical            examination, review of clinical reports from outside hospitals and laboratories, and            review of tissue biopsies.         -  Study procedures may include collection of blood, urine, saliva, nasal fluid sampling,            throat swabs, stool, and genital swabs. For participants who have specimens collected as            part of their medical care (e.g. wound swabs, spinal tap, bronchoscopy, liver biopsy            etc.), researchers may use leftover specimens from the clinical laboratory for testing.         -  Specimens may be collected up to 4 times per week during the first 2 weeks after            enrollment, and then as many as 2 times per week for up to 2 years. Some participants            may be asked to continue providing specimens if there is concern for relapse or            recurrence of the infection.         -  Treatment is not offered under this study.

Subjects will be recruited through a       variety of ways and will complete all baseline and post-intervention assessments via       specially designed electronic platforms, including REDCap and digital eHealth assessments.       There will be no in-person, on-campus interaction between the members of the study team and       research participants.       Convalescent COVID-19 subjects with persistent (i.e. > 3 months) decreased sense of smell,       and a score on the UPSIT consistent with decreased olfactory function (< 35 women, < 34 men)       will be offered enrollment. This will be a 2 x 2 factorial double-blinded,       placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial.       Subjects will be assigned to one of two nasal saline lavage interventions through a       randomization schedule developed by the Study Pharmacist. The package and detailed       instructions will be shipped directly to the subject from pharmacy. Subjects will be       requested to rinse each nasal cavity once daily for 12 weeks and to keep track of their daily       use through a paper dairy or specially created app to track compliance.       Subjects will be assigned to one of two olfactory training interventions through a       randomization schedule prepared by the Study Pharmacist. The smell training intervention will       be shipped directly to the subject. The subject will be expected to complete the smell       training for 12 weeks as instructed. Subjects will be asked to record their daily training on       a specially created app and make observations on their smell or taste function at the end of       every week.       Outcome assessments will be performed immediately upon completing nasal saline lavage and       olfactory training (Week 12) and follow-up (Week 24).     ","       As the COVID-19 pandemic spread around the world, anosmia and dysgeusia were quickly       recognized as two of the key presenting symptoms. The probability of return of smell is       related to severity of smell loss at presentation, but it appears that the loss of sense of       smell and taste seems to persist in approximately 10% of the affected patients after 6       months. As a result of COVID-19, it is estimated that within the next 12 months > 150,000       Americans will suffer permanent loss of smell. The magnitude of this impairment on the       health, safety, and quality of life is truly unprecedented and makes post-COVID olfactory       disorder a major public health problem. Thus, there is a pressing need to identify effective       treatments.       The research questions are to determine the effects of steroid nasal saline lavage and       olfactory training among adults with post-COVID olfactory dysfunction and identify       confounders and modifiers of any observed effects. To answer the research question, the       investigators propose a 2 x 2 factorial design blinded randomized clinical trial whereby 220       subjects with documented COVID-19 with anosmia/hyposmia of 12 weeks duration or longer from       Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana will be recruited electronically from COVID patient advocacy       sites, social media sites, and other internet sources. Enrolled subjects will be randomized       to nasal saline lavage with topical budesonide or placebo to address the presumed role of       inflammation in the olfactory cleft and each subject will also be randomized to olfactory       training with patient-specific, high- or low-concentration essential oil scent to assess the       role of olfactory training. Data will be analyzed in a blinded fashion to allow estimation of       observed effect size for both anti-inflammatory and olfactory training.       This innovative study will exploit the unique opportunities presented by COVID-19. The study       will use a high-tech virtual contactless research strategy, including eConsent and digital       mHealth techniques to obtain rapid answers to the research questions. The interventions are       low-cost, readily available, and results of this study can be directly disseminated to the       care of COVID-19 patients with anosmia.     ","The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) (Sensonics, New Jersey)7 is the most widely accepted olfactory identification test in North America. The UPSIT consists of four 10-page booklets, with a total of 40 items.

INTRODUCTION       5.1 Executive Summary RLF-100 (aviptadil) is a synthetic form of Vasoactive Intestinal       Polypeptide (VIP), a ubiquitous, naturally synthesized human peptide with extensively       documented anti-inflammatory, anti-cytokine cascade properties. It has been granted FDA Fast       Track Designation for treatment of Critical COVID-19 with Respiratory Failure. A phase 2/3       trial is underway that has passed its first evaluation at 30 patients for safety and       futility. This expanded access protocol is designed to offer access to investigational use of       RLF-100 to patients who do not qualify for inclusion in Protocol RLF-100-001 (NCT04311697)       either on the basis of specific medical exclusions or because there is no accessible study       site available to the prospective participant.       5.2 Definition of Critical COVID-19       In May 2020, FDA defined Critical COVID-19 to be used in clinical trials and disease staging       as follows:       Critical COVID-19         -  Positive testing by standard RT-PCR assay or an equivalent test         -  Evidence of Respiratory Failure based on FDA definition of: need for Endotracheal            intubation and mechanical ventilation, oxygen delivered by high-flow nasal cannula            (heated, humidified, oxygen delivered via reinforced nasal cannula at flow rates > 20            L/min with fraction of delivered oxygen ≥ 0.5), noninvasive positive pressure            ventilation, ECMO, or clinical diagnosis of respiratory failure (i.e., clinical need for            one of the preceding therapies, but preceding therapies not able to be administered in            setting of resource limitation)       Acute Lung Injury in COVID-19 is characterized by progressive failure of corporeal       oxygenation, attributed on large part by SARS-CoV-2 infection of Alveolar Type II cells       (Mason 2020). Extensive nonclinical studies document that 70% of VIP in the body binds to       receptors on the Alveolar Type II cell, where VIP is known to block cytokine production and       upregulate production of surfactant.       Severity of COVID is associated with and graded by a progressively worsened state of       oxygenation. This is seen in the PaO2/FIO2 ratio, which reflects the status of oxygenation       for patients on high pressure oxygen and mechanical ventilation. In patients breathing room       air, disease severity is assessed by SpO2. Many patients with Critical COVID meet the       clinical definitions of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). However, there is       increasing recognition that respiratory distress in COVID-19 has different characteristics       than ARDS in the setting of bacterial sepsis and other common presentations of ARDS.       The pathologic hallmark of COVID-19 lung injury is diffuse alveolar damage, vascular       endothelium damage, and damage to the surfactant-producing type II cells which results in       loss of the integrity of the alveolar-capillary barrier, transudation of protein-rich fluid       across the barrier, pulmonary edema, and hypoxemia from intrapulmonary shunting. Typically,       patients who have progressed to Critical COVID-19 require care in an intensive care unit       (ICU). The mortality rate is approximately 50%. Deaths usually result from multisystem organ       failure rather than lung failure alone.       5.3 RLF-100 Experimental Therapy in COVID-19       Under this protocol, patients with Critical COVID-19 will be treated with RLF-100 (Aviptadil)       with the aim to support pulmonary alveolar function, combat the cytokine-induced       inflammation, improve blood oxygenation, and reduce mortality.       5.4 Clinical Rationale Given by intravenous infusion in appropriate concentrations,       RLF-100-001 has been shown in clinical trials to have a manageable safety profile with no       observed SAEs to date that would rise to the level of a black box warning.       6. OBJECTIVES       6.1 Primary Objective The primary objective of this study is to measure the effectiveness and       safety of RLF-100 + maximal standard of care (SOC) in treating Critical COVID-19 with       Respiratory Failure.       6.2 Secondary Objective The key secondary objective is to test the hypothesis that RLF-100       improves blood oxygenation as measured by SaO2.

In vitro and in vivo antiviral activity towards SARS-CoV-2 has been reported.       Since hydroxychloroquine has been used for decades its properties as a drug are well known.       Pertinent adverse events to monitor in a hospitalized patient include QTc (corrected QT       interval) prolongation, elevation of liver enzymes/acute liver injury, and hypokalemia.       Acute lung injury and progressive respiratory failure is the major cause of mortality in       SARS-CoV-2 infection. In acute lung injury and respiratory distress syndrome, the severity of       hypoxia is categorized by the Pao2/FIO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) ration as mild (200 mm       Hg<Pao2/Fio2≤300 mm Hg), moderate (100 mm Hg<Pao2/Fio2≤200 mm Hg), and severe (Pao2/Fio2 ≤100       mm Hg). A persistently low Pao2/Fio2 ratio is associated with worse outcomes and may be a       marker of failure to respond to conventional therapy. PaO2/FIO2 is a clinically useful       measure in patients regardless of if they are receiving noninvasive supplemental O2 or       mechanical ventilation, and low ratios are associated with duration of ICU stay and hospital       mortality.       The care of hospitalized patients with covid-19 is evolving with hospital guidelines arising       across the U.S. with several commonalities. Patients receive clinical assessment, chest       x-ray, covid-19 testing, basic labs (WBC, CMP), and additional labs based on protocol or       clinical judgment (ABG, CRP-C reactive protein, LDH), antibiotics for possible bacterial       pneumonia, acetaminophen for fever, supplemental O2, close monitoring for worsening       respiratory status and consideration for mechanical ventilation. Since covid-19 is a novel       illness, there is no proven clinically efficacious drug treatment. Candidate drugs are being       used, some in the context of trials and others by physician discretion. Early intubation over       escalating noninvasive support (ie. High flow nasal canula and bipap) has been adopted due to       the frequency of rapidly worsening oxygenation, hemodynamic instability, and to protect staff       from virus aerosolization. Low tidal volume ventilation and prone positioning are lung       protective strategies used in critically ill covid-19 patients that are based on management       of acute respiratory distress syndrome generally. Arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, and shock are       serious complications from covid-19 that warrant avoidance of acidosis, electrolyte       monitoring and replacement, and pressor support. Conservative fluid replacement is used to       avoid worsening oxygenation. In sum, multiple factors including timeliness and quality of       care likely affect patient outcomes. Hospitalists and pulmonary critical care physicians       direct the care of covid-19 patients with support from specialists as needed including       infectious disease, cardiology, and nephrology.       Pragmatic trials focus on studying the real-world effect of an intervention, such as a       medication, in the context of other care a patient is likely to receive. The intervention is       delivered by staff normally taking care of the patient with monitoring that is routinely       available. Advantages can include generalizability, increased physician participation due to       less burdensome study protocols, and feasibility. Disadvantages include allowance of       unblinded design, bias from physicians and patients about the intervention, and more       heterogeneity in treatment than in a mechanistic protocolized trial. Efforts to minimize bias       include selecting objective outcomes (e.g. PaO2/FIO2 rather than cough or dyspnea).     ","       Novel coronavirus SARS(Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)-CoV-2 was first identified during       the outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019 with the now resulting pandemic. Aggressive       supportive care is the mainstay of treatment currently and rescue with lung protective       mechanical ventilation is essential for survival in patients with severe acute respiratory       distress syndrome. Despite supportive care, mortality is significant in hospitalized patients       in the U.S., especially among patients > 65 years of age. Pharmacologic treatments to       decrease disease severity are urgently needed. Hydroxychloroquine is currently widely used       for treatment of autoimmune disease including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid       arthritis, and it has been used to prevent and treat malaria. In vitro and in vivo antiviral       activity towards SARS-CoV-2 has been reported. Since hydroxychloroquine has been used for       decades its properties as a drug are well known. The investigators propose a pragmatic trial       of hydroxychloroquine in moderately ill hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with       the hypothesis that hydroxychloroquine reduces severity of acute lung injury caused by       SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The World Health Organization (WHO) designated the       respiratory disease as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on February 12, 2020. Numerous reports       have since characterized the COVID-19 clinical syndrome, ranging from asymptomatic/mild       disease to severe disease leading to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation       (i.e., ARDS, multi-organ failure, sepsis, and death).       A safe, effective, and inexpensive therapy is urgently needed, one that can alter the natural       course of the disease process and reduce strain on healthcare systems. High Dose Intravenous       Vitamin C is a safe and possibly effective treatment for ARDS and has been described to be       effective for ARDS of viral origin.       A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized control trial involving 167 patients with ARDS       who were randomized to receive 50 mg/kg every 6 hours of HDIVC for 4 days versus placebo       showed a statistically significant difference in 28-day all-cause mortality. The 28-day       mortality was 29.8% in the vitamin C group versus 46.3% in the placebo group, although this       was a secondary outcome.       This can be translated as a Number Needed to Treat (NNT) of 6-8 patients to save one life       from ARDS. The statistical effect on mortality remained up to 60-days following trial       completion.       The first study, published in 1986, treated 16 ARDS patients with intravenous vitamin C (1000       mg IV every 6 hours) plus antioxidants versus 16 ARDS patients who received the standard care       at that time (i.e., control group). There was a reduction in mortality in the vitamin C       group: 37% versus 71% in the standard care group (p<0.01). A phase I trial in 2014 proved       that plasma vitamin C in patients with severe sepsis and ARDS were low, almost at scorbutic       levels and that HDIVC administration had a dose-dependent effect in the prevention of       multi-organ failure, as measured by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores.       Patients who received a total of 200 mg/kg/day of HDIVC for 4 days (administered in 50       mg/kg/dose, every 6 hours), had significantly lower organ failure scores than placebo, and       even lower scores than the patients who received lower-doses of IV vitamin C (50 mg/kg/day       administered at 12.5 mg/kg/dose, every 6 hours for 4 days). In this trial, the patients in       the HDIVC group (200 mg/kg/day) achieved plasma levels up to 3,000 µM on day 4.       To assess the treatment effect of a 72-hour intravenous vitamin C infusion protocol (100       mg/kg every 8 hours) in patients with hypoxemia and suspected COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus       ID-19). In the course of performing this phase 2 trial researchers will explore three       following hypotheses:       Primary Endpoint: HDIVC infusion will increase 28-day ventilator-free days. Secondary       Endpoint A: HDIVC infusion will reduce 28-day all-cause hospital mortality.       Secondary Endpoint B: HDIVC infusion will significantly increase acute inflammation-free days       (defined as CRP >=10 mg/L) among COVID-19 patients.       Secondary Endpoint C: HDIVC infusion will be safe, as demonstrated by organ-failure-free days       up to 28 days.     ",       This study will test to see if a 72-hour intravenous vitamin C infusion protocol (100 mg/kg       every 8 hours) in patients with hypoxemia and suspected COVID-19 will reduce the lung injury       caused by the SARS-Cov-2.     ,Documented days free off mechanical ventilation the first 28 days post enrollment,Number of ventilator-free days,"Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center; Richmond; Virginia; 23249; Brian Davis, MD; brian.davis1@vcuhealth.org|Virginia Commonwealth University; Richmond; Virginia; 23298","Markos G Kashiouris, MD MPH; 804-305-7187; mkashiouris@vcu.edu"

The vaccine is designed to create high titers of memory immune cells that are       specific to the foreign antigens in the living cell vaccine. Upon encounter with any type of       virus, these memory immune cells are activated and release cytokines including an immediate       release of IFN-ϒ. This non-specific activation causes immune conditions similar to the       conditions that occur in healthy younger patients that leads to rapid viral clearance and       viral-specific memory immune response to clear infection and protect against recurrence.

They have regularly supplied their water       products to the PI for laboratory testing, including measuring an activity attributed to the       absorption of an environmental force, referred to by the PI as KELEA, an abbreviation for       Kinetic Energy Limiting Electrostatic Attraction. KELEA is regarded as the source of cellular       energy for the body''s alternative cellular energy (ACE) pathway. This pathway can provide a       non-immunological defense mechanism against infections, presumably including coronaviruses.       The proposed study is to test water products from several suppliers, as well as a naturally       available source of KELEA activated water in symptomatic individuals who have tested positive       by either PCR or antigen testing for Covid-19. The initial mode of administration will be by       inhalation using a nebulizer or diffuser. Several deep inhalations will be taken on 5       occasions daily.

Typically, the virus first       colonizes in the upper respiratory tract (URT) causing clinical symptoms such as coughing,       sore throat, and then is transferred to the lower respiratory tract (LRT) which can lead to       severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, and death, if it is not       managed.       The World Health Organization (WHO) has presented comprehensive guidelines underscoring       personal hygiene measures including respiratory hygiene against SARS, MERS, influenza, and       now SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19. While personal protection equipment (PPE), personal hygiene       measures, environmental infection control, and physical distancing are crucial in mitigating       disease transmission, respiratory hygiene measures do not prevent SARS-CoV-2 colonization in       URTs and LRTs of infected individuals (symptomatic and asymptomatic).       Experimental and clinical research studies on infections similar to COVID-19 such as SARS,       MERS, and H5N1 have shown that using antiseptic mouthwash/gargling solutions, such as       products containing chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine (PVP-I),       chlorine dioxide (ClO2), cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can       reduce viral load. A randomized controlled trial (N=387) showed efficacy and       cost-effectiveness of gargling with water or a product containing PVP-I (3X/day, 20 seconds)       on URTIs in healthy volunteers (18-65 years) over 60 days from a societal perspective; in       vitro studies have shown that CloSYS, an over the counter mouthwash containing ClO2, was       effective on inactivating SARS-CoV as well as disinfecting infected surfaces, dental unit       waterlines, and biofilms in ultrasonic dental scaling units. Recently, the US Centers for       Disease Control (CDC) and the American Dental Association (ADA) have recommended using a       mouthwash containing 1.0-1.5% H2O2 as a pre-procedural rinse before dental treatment to       potentially reduce SARS-CoV-2 load; however, no in vivo clinical studies have been conducted       to support this claim.       The aim of this pilot trial is to evaluate the effect of three over the counter antiseptic       mouthwash/gargling solutions compared to a control (distilled water) to reduce SARS-CoV-2       load. In addition, study participants will be assessed for the severity of their clinical       symptoms during the study period. The 4-week protocol was selected as studies have shown that       patients can continue to shed the virus and potentially transmit to the others for a 2 to 4       week period. An interim analysis is planned when 10 participants per arm (50 total) complete       the study using the alpha-spending function with O''Brien-Fleming boundary rule.     ","       In this pilot trial, 150 confirmed COVID-19 individuals will be randomly assigned to 1 of 5       groups: distilled water, CloSYS (Rowpar Pharmaceutical Inc., USA), Oral-B Mouth Sore (Oral-B,       USA), Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection (Crest, USA), or Listerine (Johnson and Johnson,       USA).       Study participants will be asked to rinse/gargle with 10ml (2 teaspoons) of the assigned       solutions 4 times per day, for 30 seconds, for 4 weeks.

The objective is to use a network targeted sampling design to direct testing to       yield a higher proportion of results which indicate active infection and possibly       differentiating between venues or communities where transmission is active and undiagnosed.       Study activities: A person who tests positive for COVID-19 will be given a set of tokens to       give to contacts that will entitle these contacts to make an appointment to receive a test       for COVID-19.       Population groups: The population group will include people with index cases of COVID-19 and       their contacts for the past 14 days. As these contacts are tested and receive positive       results, they will be given tokens to hand out to their contacts over the past 14 days. The       network of positive cases will blossom to reveal community transmission and asymptomatic       cases, thus giving researchers an indication of disease prevalence.       Data analysis: At the completion of each epoch and at the end of the study, we will scale the       social networks up and conduct network analysis using SAS and the igraph package in R. These       analyses will be applied in an ongoing manner to guide selection of seeds in subsequent       epochs to ensure representativeness and to guide selection of alters to encourage longer       referral chain lengths.       Risk/safety issues: The primary risks include discomfort from the nasal swab and risks from       the venous blood draw used in testing and the potential loss of confidentiality. All efforts       will be made to securely manage the data to ensure participant confidentiality.     ","       The primary objective is to use network targeted sampling design to detect active and/or       undiagnosed cases of COVID-19 in the community and determine the spread or distribution of 1)       active infection, and 2) past exposure. The hypothesis is that there are many undiagnosed       and/or asymptomatic people in the community who may be unknowingly spreading the virus or       have been exposed and have antibodies.

In the context of the recent COVID19 pandemic, people with mitochondrial       disease are at increased risk for severe disease and poor outcomes if infected. However, the       mechanisms for this link between infection and clinical decline are incompletely understood.       Given that people with mitochondrial disease are particularly susceptible to infection and       may experience delayed recovery, we hypothesize that this is in part due to immune factors       that influence host-pathogen interactions. The purpose of this protocol is to collect       biological specimens to identify immune signatures that contribute to the phenotype of       infection and outcomes in patients with mitochondrial disease who become ill during the       COVID19 pandemic. In order to compare these cases with others of similar genetic backgrounds       and environmental exposures, we will also collect specimens from family members. We will then       examine how these signatures correlate with comprehensive quantifiable clinical measures       throughout the course of disease, from presenting symptoms, through acute decompensation,       stabilization and convalescence. While this protocol is developed during the COVID-19       pandemic with a focus on a specific infectious pathogen, we hope that this study will extend       beyond the pandemic in an effort to more broadly understand acute infectious illness in       patients with mitochondrial disease. Additionally, it will serve as a remote adjunct to the       NIH MINI Study, a natural history study focused on the immunophenotype of mitochondrial       disease that is conducted at the NIH Clinical Center.     ","       Background:       Mitochondrial disease is a rare disorder. It can cause poor growth, developmental delays,       muscle weakness, and other symptoms. The disease is usually inherited. It can be present at       birth or develop later in life. Infection is a major cause of disease and death in people       with this disease. Researchers want to learn more about how infection and the declining       health of people who have this disease may be related to the COVID-19 pandemic. To do this,       researchers will study the DNA of people who become ill with suspected or confirmed       coronavirus. Their DNA will be compared to the DNA of their family members.       Objective:       To learn more about how genes may play a role in how COVID-19 affects people with       mitochondrial disease.       Eligibility:       People age 2 months and older with mitochondrial disease and a suspected or confirmed       diagnosis of COVID-19.<TAB>       Design:       Participants will complete a questionnaire about their health history. Their medical records       may be reviewed. They will give a blood sample.       If the participant becomes ill, they may have a videoconference with a doctor or nurse at the       NIH to perform a physical exam. They may be contacted after their illness to give updates on       their health. They may be asked to give extra blood samples or complete extra questionnaires.       Participants genetic data will be put into a database. The data will be labeled with a code       and not their name. The data will be shared with other researchers.

To determine the effectiveness of enoxaparin and       apixaban in patients hospitalized (but not yet intubated) with confirmed COVID-19 and 2. To       determine the safety of enoxaparin and apixaban in patients hospitalized (but not yet       intubated) with confirmed COVID-19. Observational analyses have suggested potential benefit       for in-hospital use of anticoagulation. Yet, due to a lack of rigorous evidence for optimal       anticoagulation regimens, practice patterns among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 vary       significantly. Specifically, the choice of anticoagulant, dosing, and duration of treatment       are not well understood. A preliminary analysis of approximately 2700 patients admitted to       the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) in New York, demonstrated an association between       in-hospital administration of therapeutic Anticoagulation (AC) and improved survival compared       to no or prophylactic dose AC. A subsequent analysis under review of a larger 4400 patient       cohort with longer follow up demonstrated similar associations with reduction in the risk of       mortality and risk of intubation. Further analyses suggest more pronounced benefit with       therapeutic as opposed to prophylactic doses. Bleeding rates were generally low overall, but       higher among patients on therapeutic anticoagulation. Finally, though exploratory in nature,       a potential signal for benefit was observed for patients on novel oral anticoagulant therapy       (primarily apixaban) at therapeutic doses compared to low molecular weight heparin.       Ultimately, randomized controlled trials are needed to elucidate the optimal anticoagulation       regimen to improve outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.     ","       Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2       (SARS-CoV-2), has led to unprecedented morbidity and mortality in the modern era. To date,       nearly 13 million people have contracted COVID-19, leading to more than 550,000 deaths       worldwide. As the number of affected individuals continues to climb, effective strategies for       treatment and prevention of the disease are of paramount importance. SARS-CoV-2 is understood       to directly invade cells via the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which       is expressed predominantly in the lungs but also throughout the cardiovascular system. Thus,       while acute respiratory distress syndrome remains a feared complication, new thromboembolic       disease has emerged as a common and potentially catastrophic manifestation of COVID-19.

A variety of       epithelial cells express the ACE2 receptor which contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD)       used by SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 to enter the cells. While direct infection of RTEC has not       yet been proven data from multiple laboratories show virus in the kidney. It is this direct       viral involvement of the RTEC that this proposal seeks to address.       One relatively simple approach would be to perturb the ability of the RBD to bind to its       cellular (hACE2) receptor. Changes in pH may cause each amino acid residue, in the RBD, to       assume a slightly different ''microscopic'' conformation-dependent pKa value. Urine pH is       normally 5.5- 6.5 (not too dissimilar to alveolar fluid-6.4-6.86) and can be easily and       safely manipulated. In fact, urine alkalinization protocols have been used for decades to       reduce renal toxicity from various compounds (especially chemotherapy) and are recommended by       US and European toxicology societies. Here, the strategy will be deployed not for ion       trapping but to inhibit the virus from infecting RTEC. Alkalinizing the urine using IV       sodium-bicarbonate solution to pH of 7.5 or more can be easily and safely achieved.       While severe AKI does not appear to be a major part of the SARS-CoV-2 syndrome for most       patients, when severe AKI does occur, mortality is very high and preventing early AKI may       reduce AKI severity as the disease progresses.     ","       Our overarching goal is to improve the outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients with or       at risk for development of acute kidney injury (AKI). The objective of this study is to       determine the role of a protocol to manage urine alkalization using a simple medication that       has been used for a very long time, is safe, and without significant side-effects. We aim to       determine the feasibility and safety of a urine alkalinization protocol for the prevention of       AKI in patients testing positive for COVID-19.

Patients with hypertension, diabetes,       coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular illness, lung disease and kidney dysfunction       commonly have elevated levels of plasmin/plasminogen and it was proposed that this may be the       mechanism for poorer outcomes in patients with these co-morbidities. A logical treatment that       might blunt this process would be the inhibition of the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin.       Fortunately, there is an inexpensive, commonly used drug, tranexamic acid (TXA) which       suppresses this conversion and could be re-purposed for the treatment of COVID19. TXA is a       synthetic analog of the amino acid lysine which reversibly binds four to five lysine receptor       sites on plasminogen. This reduces conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, and is normally used       to prevent fibrin degradation. TXA is FDA approved for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding       (typical dose 1300 mg p.o. three times per day x 5 days) and off-label use for many other       indications. TXA is used perioperatively as a standard-of-care at the University of Alabama       at Birmingham (UAB) for orthopedic and cardiac bypass surgeries. At UAB, it is commonly       employed in hemorrhaging trauma patients and currently is being studied for perioperative use       in Cesarean section surgeries. It has also been utilized for spinal surgery, neurosurgery,       orthognathic surgeries and even long term for the treatment of cosmetic dermatological       disorders with a long track record of safety.       Given the potential benefit and limited toxicity of TXA it would appear warranted to perform       a rapid randomized, double-blind placebo controlled exploratory trial at UAB in the treatment       of the early phases of COVID19 to determine whether it reduces infectivity and virulence of       the COVID19 virus as hypothesized. Involvement of each patient is only for 7 days before       primary endpoints.       An exploratory, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 clinical trial in which       study patients have just been admitted to the regular hospital (non-Intensive Care Unit; ICU)       for the diagnosis of COVID19 is proposed. The overall goal of this exploratory study is to       assess both safety and efficacy of 5 days of TXA versus placebo in the COVID19 population.       All patients would also receive daily anticoagulation as directed by their primary care team.       The primary endpoint for the study would be a need for transfer to an ICU. Contact would be       daily and via remote processes. Care for the COVID19 patient would otherwise be standard of       care and directed by the primary caretakers of the patient.

Infant feeding and growth pattern from medical records and       growth charts. COVID-19 serology test (optional).     ","       Newborns and infants receive passive natural immunity through maternal antibodies present in       breastmilk to fight infections caused by viruses such as the COVID-19, until they develop       active immunity by illness or vaccination. Such immunity will become the main stay for       preventing future waves of COVID-19 epidemics. The high COVID-19 mortality among African       Americans is ascribed partly to compromised immune status associated with comorbidity.       Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) is the effective low-cost natural strategy for building       immunity right from birth. African Americans record the lowest EBF rates and also lack       workplace support. This intervention includes a 10-hour course extracted from 90-hour CLC       online program, sufficient to prepare physicians to partner with certified lactation       consultant (CLC) to provide their patients comprehensive COVID-19 breastfeeding guidelines,       training, and support to afford their babies the benefits of breastmilk antibodies, the best       line of defense against COVID-19, until availability of safe vaccines. The Breastfeeding       Report Card indicates slow improvements in overall breastfeeding rates with persisting       disparities. Improving EBF rates can contribute to increased COVID-19 immunity among infants.       Preliminary data in Nashville indicates excellent breastfeeding benefit knowledge and intent,       but limited training to succeed. Hospital staff encourage breastfeeding but routinely offer       formula at birth. Most physicians who provide prenatal care do not actively promote       breastfeeding nor routinely offer CLC referral. This single action by physicians can halt       routines that compromise successful EBF. The program long-term goal is to prepare       obstetricians to actively promote comprehensive breastfeeding among African American mothers.       The immediate objective is to develop and evaluate feasibility and effectiveness of an       intervention designed to increase COVID-19 breastfeeding guideline adherence and improve EBF       skills and rates among African American mothers. The rationale is that mothers who receive       physician prenatal encouragement and CLC referral will make confident informed decisions,       adopt COVID-19 breastfeeding guidelines, safely meet their EBF goals, and provide their       infants with appropriate antibodies. The expected outcome is that patient participants will       adhere to COVID-19 breastfeeding guidelines and record 3-month EBF rate 60 percent or       greater.

Approximately 80 subjects randomized 1:1 (40 dapansutrile, 40 placebo) are       planned to be enrolled.       At the Screening/Baseline/Day 1 Visit, subjects will provide informed consent, be screened       for eligibility, and be randomized/enrolled into the study. Subjects will also receive the       first dose of study drug at this visit once study eligibility has been confirmed, and the       second dose of study drug will be taken approximately 12 hours after the first dose. Study       drug will be continued twice daily (morning and evening doses) through Day 14.       The trial duration will be approximately 45 days for all subjects enrolled, with assessments       as follows: Screening/Baseline/Day 1, Day 4, Day 8, Day 15 (±1 day), Day 29 (±3 days), and       Day 45 (± 3 days). The Day 29 and Day 45 follow-up visits may be conducted virtually via the       institution''s telehealth process.       Each subject will be asked to maintain two paper diaries at home daily for the first 14 days:       a dosing diary and a subject diary. The dosing diary will be used to record the number of       capsules taken each morning and evening. The subject diary will be used to record       temperature, oxygen levels, COVID-19 symptoms, and overall health (using the prior 24-hour       period for parameters requiring subject recall). The set of questions used in the subject       diary will also be administered to the subjects at the Screening/Baseline/Day 1Visit       (pre-dose), Day 15, Day 29, and Day 45 visits. Each subject will be provided a no-contact       thermometer and a hand-held pulse oximeter at the Screening/Baseline/Day 1 Visit for home       use.       At Day 29 and Day 45, additional assessments of safety and clinical activity will occur. The       Day 29 and Day 45 follow-up visits will be conducted virtually via the sites'' telehealth       process.     ","       The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of orally administered NLRP3       inhibitor, dapansutrile, for the treatment of moderate COVID-19 symptoms and early cytokine       release syndrome (CRS) in an ambulatory, at-home setting.       Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by infection from a new strain of severe acute       respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 is characterized by fever, cough       and shortness of breath, which in certain patients can lead to systemic organ failure and       mortality.       The data show that SARS-CoV-2 activates the innate immune signaling sensor NLRP3. Activation       of NLRP3 initiates the cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which includes the production of       primary cytokine, IL-1, triggering an intense inflammatory response that is prevalent in       symptomatic COVID-19 patients. When CRS advances further to a fulminant ''cytokine storm'', the       data show that respiratory distress syndrome and multiple-organ failure take place.       As a specific inhibitor of NLRP3, dapansutrile may reduce or prevent the hyperinflammation       associated with CRS by inhibiting the production of IL-1β early to arrest the progression to       a severe ''cytokine storm.'' The end result would be a reduction in the need for COVID-19       patients to receive intensive medical treatment, allowing for fewer hospitalizations,       administration of mechanical ventilation and deaths.

This part-1 concerns only a       limited number of adults and represents a unique opportunity to probe critical questions       which are difficult to query in empirical experiments or with only retrospective information       on stress experience. (2) Collect a large dataset to examine the impact of COVID-19 stressors       on motivation pattern (approach/avoidance behavior) in function of anxiety, cognitive and       behavioral responses to the pandemic. This part-2 of the protocol is open to any individuals       interested in participating. Overall, this is a time-sensitive research on the impact of       environmental stressors generated by the COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety, motivation and       potential neural mechanisms informed by predictors. Measures collected consist of ratings of       stressors related to COVID-19 and more generally, anxiety, cognition, and behavior, including       the performance of a motivation-based task (finger-pressing task). and an attention bias task       (dot-probe task). This research will use a study website to consent, survey participants       online, and tasks.       Objectives:       The primary objective is to examine the relationship of affective, cognitive and behavioral       responses to stressors related to COVID-19 with neuroimaging and behavioral data collected       previously, before COVID-19. This research will identify risk and resilience factors (neural       and behavioral) among study participants regarding their responses to COVID-19 crisis. The       secondary objective is to gather a large dataset to provide information on how sustained       environmental stress affect motivated behavior, particularly with respect to biasing behavior       towards avoidance, and how individual factors such as anxiety and cognitive function       influence the impact on patterns of motivation. These data are expected to help the       interpretation of the role of neuroimaging findings.       Endpoints:       The endpoints are 2-fold: anxiety and motivation pattern responses to COVID-19 stressors (1)       in function of clinical phenotype; and (2) in function of endophenotype previously collected       using high-resolution 7T fMRI. These endpoints will be measured twice using the same online       platform approximately 8 months later.       Study Population:       The sample size will be up to 3000 healthy volunteers and anxiety participants. Participants       will be males and females, 18 years and older. They must be English-speaking. The study       population will include patient and volunteer participants who have consented for an SFNA       study in the past (protocols 01-M-0185, 02-M-0321, 03-M-0093 and 14-M-0114), or NIMH healthy       volunteer study (17-M-0181) as well as new participants from the general population who       respond to advertisements for the SNFA -COVID study but who have not previously been a NIMH       study participant.

The       study itself will be conducted entirely online through a secure study website where consent       and study measures will be completed and repeated as specified.       Description of Study Intervention:       There are no study interventions as this is a descriptive behavioral health survey study,       including questionnaires and computer tasks.       Study Duration:       The estimated time from study initiation to study completion approximately one year as this       is a time-sensitive study whose results should be analyzed and disseminated rapidly.       Participant Duration:       It is expected that participants will participate in the study for up to 8 months with an       option to recontact in the future.     ","       Background:       Researchers think that people s mental health and behavior will be very affected by the steps       taken to slow the spread of COVID-19, such as social distancing. Also, the threat of disease       and death, to people and their loved ones, can cause much stress. Researchers want to learn       more about these stressors and how they are affecting people.

Understanding the       mechanisms by which BTK inhibition modulates the host inflammatory response in patients with       COVID-19 is critical in order to better understand COVID-19 pathogenesis.       In this multisite natural history laboratory study, hospitalized patients with COVID-19       (n=80) will be recruited at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and The Johns       Hopkins Hospital. Forty of these patients will be recipients of BTK inhibition, either as       part of their standard clinical care or in another clinical trial. The other 40 will not be       recipients of BTK inhibition and will serve as a control group. A third group of patients       without COVID-19 (n=40) who will be recipients of BTK inhibition for other clinical       indications will also be enrolled as a second control group.       Participants will have three or four longitudinal blood draws and may be asked to provide       stool samples. All specimens and data will be coded and sent to the National Institutes of       Health (NIH) for research analysis. Only site investigators will have access to the code s       key for their respective sites; the NIH investigators will not have the keys. Coded blood       samples will be used for genetic testing, transcriptional analyses, deep immunological       phenotyping, soluble biomarker analysis, and other research tests. Coded clinical and       laboratory data from routine care (e.g., basic demographic information, vital signs,       medications, clinical labs, and radiologic imaging findings) will also be captured. Coded       stool samples may be collected as part of this study to determine whether viable SARS-CoV-2       is present in stool, which will help advance our understanding of pathogenesis and enteric       transmission.     ","       Background:       Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory syndrome. It is caused by the       SARS-CoV-2 virus. People with severe COVID-19 infection have a hyper-inflammatory response.       Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) plays a role in the innate immune system. BTK inhibition can be       used to target the innate immune system that appears to contribute to mortality. This could       be an effective way to help the inflammatory responses in people with COVID-19.       Objective:       To learn more about the immunologic mechanisms by which BTK inhibition may decrease       hyper-inflammatory responses in people with COVID-19.       Eligibility:       People ages 18 and older in one of the following groups:         -  They are in the hospital with COVID-19. They will or will not be treated with a BTK            inhibitor.         -  They do not have COVID-19. They are or are not in the hospital. They will be treated            with a BTK inhibitor for a reason other than COVID-19.       Design:       Participants will be screened with a review of their demographic and clinical information.       Their medical history will be reviewed. If they have COVID-19, their symptoms will be       assessed.       Participants will give 3-4 blood samples. These may be taken through a vein. They may also be       taken through an existing central venous catheter.       Participants may give a stool sample. This will be collected by nursing staff. It will be       collected using a stool collection vial. Stool collection is optional.       Participants samples will be collected over about 7 days. These will be used for research and       genetic testing.

This pandemic has become an unprecedented global       threat to individuals, communities and health systems. While immediate attention has       appropriately focused on prevention and treatment of SARS CoV-2 infection, the widespread       societal mental health consequences of the pandemic cannot be ignored. Given the catastrophic       impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical to prospectively and longitudinally assess       the impact on alcohol use and problems, along with associated behaviors and outcomes. Thus,       the goal of this study is to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on alcohol use and       consequences in individuals across the spectrum of alcohol use and alcohol use disorder.       Objectives:       The specific aims of this study are:         1. To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on alcohol consumption and consequences            in individuals across the spectrum of alcohol use and those with AUD.         2. To evaluate the time-course of changes in measures of negative life events, social            isolation and stress, and their effect on alcohol consumption and consequences over a            24-month period during and following the COVID-19 pandemic.         3. (Exploratory aim) To examine the role of anxiety, depression, craving, binge drinking,            impaired control in the relationships examined above.       Endpoints:       Participants will be invited to complete several surveys by phone and/or online over 2 years       at intervals that range from weekly to bimonthly in the first year and every 6 months during       the second year. Depending on the trajectory of the pandemic, the frequency of the surveys       may be modified if necessary. The surveys will assess a range of outcomes related to alcohol       consumption and consequences, along with measures of other substance use, stress, sleep,       pain, physical health and quality of life.       Study Population:       The target sample size for this study will consist of 700 participants including,       non-drinkers, light drinkers, non-treatment-seeking heavy drinkers, and treatment-seeking       individuals with alcohol use disorder who have been screened under the NIAAA Screening,       Assessment and Management (SAM) Protocol (14-AA-0181). As this is a natural history study,       recruitment will be open to all participants from the NIAAA screening protocol. We will not       select participants based on sex, gender, race, ethnicity, or age.       Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:       NIAAA Intramural Clinical Research Program located in the NIH Clinical Center, Bethesda, MD.       Study will be conducted via telephone and online survey, and participants will not have       in-person study visits.       Study Duration: 60 months       Participant Duration: 24 months     ","       Background:       The SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused a pandemic infection called COVID-19. It is a global threat       to people, communities, and health systems. Researchers are concerned about the mental health       effects of the pandemic. They want to learn more about how it is affecting people s alcohol       use and problems, and how it may continue to affect them over time.       Objective:       To study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on alcohol use and consequences in individuals       across the spectrum of alcohol use and those with alcohol use disorder.       Eligibility:       Participants who have been screened under the NIAAA Screening, Assessment and Management       Protocol (14-AA-0181)       Design:       Participants will complete a baseline survey by phone. It will ask about alcohol use, alcohol       dependence, and stress. It covers 2 time periods: the 12 months before the pandemic started       and the time since it started.       Participants will get an ID code and a link to an online survey. They will complete the       online survey within a week of the phone survey.       Participants will complete a series of online surveys over 24 months. For the first year,       surveys will be completed weekly for the first 4 weeks, then biweekly for the next 8 weeks,       and then every 1-2 months for the rest of the year. For the second year, surveys will be       completed every 6 months. Surveys will cover the following topics:         -  Alcohol use and its consequences         -  Other substance use         -  Stress         -  Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic         -  Pain         -  Physical health         -  Sleep         -  Quality of life.

More recently,       some observational studies have shown a significant association between low vitamin D status       and worse clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients. Whether vitamin D supplementation can       reduce the risk of adverse clinical outcomes in recently diagnosed COVID-19 patients and/or       reduce risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV- 2)       in those likely to have been exposed to the virus (post-exposure prophylaxis) is unknown.       The Vitamin D and COVID-19 Trial (VIVID) is a nationwide, pragmatic, cluster-randomized       clinical trial in 2700 U.S. men and women investigating whether taking a daily dietary       supplement of vitamin D3 for 4 weeks reduces the risk of hospitalization and/or death in       people newly diagnosed with COVID-19, and reduces the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in their       closest household contacts.       The trial will enroll 1500 individuals aged 30 or older who are newly diagnosed with COVID-19       (index cases), together with 1200 of their closest household contacts aged 18 or older       (limited to at most one contact per household).       Following receipt of informed consent, all participants will be randomized -- i.e., assigned       by chance (like a coin toss) -- to one of two groups: (1) daily vitamin D3 (9600 IU/day on       days 1-2; 3200 IU/day on days 3-28) or (2) daily vitamin D placebo. Index cases and their       household contacts, if any, will be assigned to the same group (cluster randomization).       Participants will take three oral softgel capsules on day 1, three capsules on day 2, and one       capsule each day on days 3 through 28. Participants will receive a 4-week supply of study       capsules via overnight courier service.       Participants will fill out a short (15-20 minute) questionnaire each week during the 4-week       pill-taking period, as well as a follow-up questionnaire at 8 weeks after randomization.       These questionnaires ask about symptoms, general health, and use of medications and dietary       supplements. Questionnaires will be completed online using a secure Internet-based system       known as the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system. Participants must have an       e-mail address to enroll in the study. Occasionally, participants (or their delegates) may       receive a telephone call from study staff to collect information or to clarify answers on the       questionnaire. Participants will be able to contact investigators or staff using a toll-free       number, if they have any questions or need assistance.       Participants (or their delegates) who indicate on a study questionnaire that they have been       hospitalized will be sent a medical release form to be signed and returned. The release form       will be used to get medical records from the participant''s physician or hospital to confirm       the specific reason for the hospitalization. In the event of a participant''s death, the       participant''s delegate will be sent a medical release form to be signed and returned. The       release form will be used to get medical records from the participant''s physician or hospital       to confirm the specific cause of death.       Participants will provide dried blood spot samples at baseline and week 4. Participants will       provide these samples using a sample collection kit mailed to their homes. Blood samples will       be collected through a finger prick onto a filter paper. Blood samples will be stored and       used to measure vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels. In participants who are not diagnosed with       COVID-19 during the study, blood samples will be also be tested for COVID-19 antibodies.

Neurotropism is one common feature of Covid-19. Such neuro-invasive propensity of Covid-19       has been documented almost for all the Beta-coronaviruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.       Increasing evidence suggests that infection with Sars-CoV-2 causes neurological deficits in a       substantial proportion of affected patients. It was observed that patients surviving COVID-19       are at high risk for subsequent development of neurological disease and in particular       Alzheimer''s disease.       NA-831 is a new neuroprotective and neurogenesis drug that has been demonstrated its       promising safety and efficacy in Phase 2A for the treatment of early onset of Alzheimer''s       disease. NA-831 in oral formulation is well tolerated NA-831 with no adverse effects. NA-831       in oral formulation exhibits predictable pharmacokinetics including dose-dependent exposure       linearity and low variability.       Based on animal studies, NA-831 can provide effective interventions during the severe acute       respiratory syndrome, and provide appropriate rehabilitation measures afterwards.       Remdesivir (GS-5734) intravenous formulation has been approved by the FDA under the emergency       use authorization for potential treatment of severe cases of Covid-19.       It was found the upper respiratory tract is the most prevalent site of SARS-CoV-2 infection       early in disease. Delivering drugs directly to the primary site of infection with a       nebulizer, inhaled nanoparticle formulation may enable more targeted and accessible       administration in non-hospitalized patients and potentially lower systemic exposure to the       drug.

During these outbreaks it is critical to gain a rapid understanding of the exposures and       immunity in the general population. Identifying exposures can be accomplished through       analysis of serum during an outbreak to identify those with specific antibodies to the       pathogen. The knowledge of the level of exposures could greatly impact the response to       current and future pandemics.       This study is a prospective, longitudinal, observational, single-center, exploratory, natural       history study to collect samples and data from individuals to identify the presence and rate       of development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in North Carolina.     ","       Background:       The SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused a pandemic. Little is known about the virus, so data is       needed to form an effective public health response. Researchers want to count how many people       have been exposed to COVID-19, learn about symptoms, and find out how many antibodies to the       SARS-CoV-2 virus a person may have in their blood over 1 year. This data could affect the       response to current and future pandemics.       Objective:       To learn how many people from a sampling of adults in North Carolina develop antibodies to       the SARS-CoV-2 virus over 1 year.       Eligibility:       Healthy people age 18 and older who do not currently have COVID-19       Design:       Participants will be screened with questions about their health.       Participants will have five 30-minute visits at the Clinical Research Unit. At each visit,       they will have blood drawn to see if they have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.       If the test result is positive for antibodies, the participant will be tested to see if they       currently have COVID-19. For this, a nasal or throat swab will be done, or saliva will be       collected. They may do this test at the same visit as the blood draw, or they may schedule an       extra visit.       Around the time of their study visits, participants will take an online survey about       themselves, their health, and COVID-19. It takes 10 minutes to complete. Every week for 52       weeks, they will also take a brief online survey about their symptoms. It takes 2 minutes to       complete.

Initial efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic were aimed at testing       symptomatic individuals, implementing stay-in-place orders, and at increasing hospital       capacity to meet surge demands. While the US continues to confront the current crisis, we       must plan for the future by putting in place tools to enhance our ability to conduct       effective screening, containment, and case management.       Widespread COVID-19 testing is needed to safely and effectively reopen schools and businesses       across the US. However, currently approved testing options require reagents that are limited       in supply, severely hindering scalability. Emerging evidence indicates that saliva testing       with the option of at-home sample collection can accurately identify COVID-19 viral       infection. Additional diagnostic testing options will continue to increase patient access.       Moreover, this approach provides an option for the easy, safe and convenient collection of       samples required for testing without traveling to a doctor''s office, hospital, or testing       site. Collection by the patient also reduces exposure of health care workers to the virus and       preserves limited personal protective equipment.       With access to expanded testing, health systems and universities will need to test       alternative methods to manage COVID-19 spread while balancing program effectiveness,       feasibility, costs, and scalability. Insights from the field of behavioral economics offer       promise for designing and sustaining these kinds of policies. Specifically, research has       demonstrated that an opt-out framed recruitment strategy compared to a conventional opt-in       strategy can improve enrollment and adherence to behavioral interventions.       For these reasons, the investigators propose to evaluate the implementation of a COVID-19       screening program that uses saliva-based testing and to test approaches to improve program       enrollment.     ","       In order to safely and effectively reopen businesses and universities across the US,       institutions will need to develop approaches to rapidly identify COVID-19 cases and manage       their spread while balancing program effectiveness, feasibility, costs, and scalability.       The investigators will evaluate the implementation of a COVID-19 screening program that       coordinates several existing systems at the University of Pennsylvania including saliva-based       viral testing and test different outreach strategies (opt-in vs opt-out) to improve program       enrollment.

NCT04384445,2020-09-08,Recruiting,Phase 1/Phase 2,Interventional,Zofin (Organicell Flow) for Patients With COVID-19,"A Phase I/II Randomized, Double Blinded, Placebo Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Potential Efficacy of Intravenous Infusion of Zofin for the Treatment of Moderate to SARS Related to COVID-19 Infection vs Placebo",Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome|COVID-19|Corona Virus Infection|SARS,Placebo;Zofin,All,18,,No,33143,Treatment,Randomized,Parallel Assignment,,Double,"       A human coronavirus (HCoV-19) has caused the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak       worldwide. Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The       majority of cases result in mild symptoms, but some can progress into pneumonia and       multi-organ failure. According to the severity it is divided into mild, normal, severe and       critically ill, which is associated with ICU admission and mortality. At present, the       standard treatment of COVD-19 patients is oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and       medications to maintain blood pressure. As of today, no specific antiviral therapy is       available for patients with COVID-19. Immune activation in some patients, and the appearance       of cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) is one of the important causes of severe damage to lungs and       other organs, which may lead to death. There is an urgent need to develop new interventions       to suppress the excessive immune response in a timely manner during the course of disease,       protect alveolar function, and reduce lung and systemic organ damage.       Zofin is an acellular, minimally manipulated product, derived from human amniotic fluid       (HAF). This product contains over 300 growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines as well as       other extracellular vesicles/nanoparticles derived from amniotic stem and epithelial cells.       The product contains a mean concentration of 5.24x10^11 particles/mL with a mean mode size of       125.2nm. Surface marker analysis confirmed the presence of exosome associated proteins CD63,       CD81, and CD9 in addition to high expression of CD133. The completed sequencing revealed 102       commonly expressed miRNA (with a 100-copy expression minimum). Bioinformatics analysis linked       63 miRNAs to 1216 RNA targets. Major players in the proinflammatory cytokine cascade found to       be targeted by miRNA were discovered in Organicell''s product include TNF, IL-6, and IL-8.       Additionally, a broader array of pro-inflammatory cytokines is also targeted by the       collection of miRNA such as FGF2, IFNB1, IGF1, IL36a, IL37, TGF-B2, VEGFA, CCL8, and CXCL12.       It has been suggested in published research that inhibition or suppression of this       pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade may reduce the severity of symptoms associated with       elevated immune response. Furthermore, the miRNA was found to target 148 genes associated       with immune response.       The property of Zofin demonstrates the therapeutic potential as a suppressor of cytokine       activation for the reduction of COVID-19 infection severity. This study aims to investigate       safety and potential efficacy of HAF derived acellular product in subjects suffering form       COVID-19 infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).     ",       The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of       Intravenous Infusion of Zofin for treatment of moderate to severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome       (SARS) related to COVID-19 infection vs Placebo.     ,Safety will be defined by the incidence of severe adverse events as assessed by treating physician,Incidence of any infusion associated adverse events,Larkin Community Hospital; South Miami; Florida; 33143; Tania Morejon; tmorejon@alternative-ra.com; 305-284-7500,"Maria Ines Mitrani, MD, PhD; 1-888-963-7881; clinicaltrials@organicell.com"

Phase 2 has safety as the primary endpoint and       approximately 40 patients will be enrolled. A pause in enrollment will occur until the DSMB       performs an initial safety assessment of Phase 2. Phase 3 is designed to determine whether       bardoxolone methyl increases the probability of recovery at Day 29 compared with matching       placebo. In phase 3, approximately additional 360-400 patients will be enrolled. Patients       will be randomized using permuted block randomization in a 1:1 fashion to either once-daily       administration of bardoxolone methyl (20 mg) or matching placebo. Patients will be stratified       by study center and invasive mechanical ventilation (i.e., mechanical ventilation with       endotracheal intubation) use at baseline (yes or no). Enrollment of patients ≥70 years of age       may be limited (e.g., comprise no more than 10% of all randomized patients), pending safety       review by the DSMB and executive committee. Treatment will be administered for the duration       of hospitalization (until recovery), with an expected duration of 10 days. For patients who       are hospitalized for more than 10 days, treatment can be continued for a maximum treatment       duration of 29 days. Dose de-escalation (down to 10 mg) is permitted during the study if       indicated clinically, and subsequent dose re-escalation is also permitted.       Patients in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 portions of the study will follow the same schedule of       dosing and study assessments. Following randomization on Day 1, patients will be assessed       while hospitalized on Days 3, 5, 8, 11, 15, 22, and 29. Assessments will include clinical       status assessments, vital sign measurements, clinical chemistry collection, and adverse event       collection. Patients that recover prior to Day 29 will complete an end-of-treatment visit.       Patients will have an in-person follow-up on Day 29, regardless of treatment adherence and       recovery status prior to Day 29, and a safety follow-up 60 days after randomization for       clinical status assessments, vital sign measurements, clinical chemistry collection, and       adverse event collection. Follow-up in-person visits are preferred but recognizing quarantine       and other factors may limit the subject''s ability to return to the site for the visit. In       this case, the visit may be performed by phone.

The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 infection is broad, encompassing asymptomatic infection,       mild upper respiratory tract illness, and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and       death. The risk of thrombotic complications is increased, even as compared to other viral       respiratory illnesses, such as influenza. A pro-inflammatory cytokine response as well as       induction of procoagulant factors associated with COVID-19 has been proposed to contribute to       thrombosis as well as plaque rupture through local inflammation. Patients with COVID-19 are       at increased risk for arterial and vein thromboembolism, with high rates observed despite       thromboprophylaxis. Autopsy reports have noted micro and macro vascular thrombosis across       multiple organ beds consistent with an early hypercoagulable state.       Notably, in COVID-19, data in the U.K. and U.S. document that infection and outcomes of       infection are worse in African and Hispanic descent persons than in other groups. The reasons       for this are uncertain.       Viral Infection and Thrombosis A large body of literature links inflammation and coagulation;       altered hemostasis is a known complication of respiratory viral infections. Procoagulant       markers are severely elevated in viral infections. Specifically, proinflammatory cytokines in       viral infections upregulate expression of tissue factor, markers of thrombin generation,       platelet activation, and down-regulate natural anticoagulant proteins C and S.       Studies have demonstrated significant risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary       embolism (PE), and myocardial infarction (MI) associated with viral respiratory infections.       In a series of patients with fatal influenza H1N1, 75% had pulmonary thrombi on autopsy (a       rate considerably higher than reported on autopsy studies among the general intensive care       unit population). Incidence ratio for acute myocardial infarction in the context of Influenza       A is over 10. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS CoV-1) and influenza have       been associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), endothelial damage, DVT,       PE, and large artery ischemic stroke. Patients with Influenza H1N1 and acute respiratory       distress syndrome (ARDS) had a 23.3-fold higher risk for pulmonary embolism, and a 17.9-fold       increased risk for deep vein thrombosis. Compared to those treated with systemic       anticoagulation, those without treatment were 33 times more likely to suffer a VTE.       Thrombosis, both microvascular and macrovascular, is a prominent feature in multiple organs       at autopsy in fatal cases of COVID-19. Thrombosis may thus contribute to respiratory failure,       renal failure, and hepatic injury in COVID-19. The number of megakaryocytes in tissues is       higher than in other forms of ARDS, and thrombi are platelet-rich based on specific staining.       Thrombotic stroke has been reported in young COVID-19 patients with no cardiovascular risk       factors. Both arterial and venous thrombotic events have been seen in increasing numbers of       hospitalized patients infected with COVID-19. The incidence of thrombosis has ranged from 10       to 30% in hospitalized patients; however, this varies by type of thrombosis captured       (arterial or vein) and severity of illness (ICU level care, requiring mechanical ventilation,       etc.).

This is a       situation the researchers could never have envisioned before it happened. Of course, this has       triggered an inordinate amount of stress. Research shows that chronic stress leaves one       imbalanced and one''s health and happiness to suffer. Research has also demonstrated that how       one thinks about stress determines how the body responds to it. Simple mindfulness practices       provide healthier ways to deal with stress. In this study, the researchers will introduce       modified mindfulness practices that can be practiced in the healthcare setting or at home.       All of the practices are based on mindfulness principles. Mindfulness refers to a state of       being present in the moment, on purpose, and without judgment. Mindfulness Based Stress       Reduction is an 8 week, 2 hours/week curriculum that has shown results for over 40 years.       All the practices in this study are adapted from that protocol.       The intervention includes several mindfulness practices including an awareness of breath       focus instruction, breath-and-body coordination and awareness instruction, and instruction in       identifying times to practice these exercises. The intervention will be delivered virtually       2-day/week, twice/day, for four weeks.       Effectiveness will be measured by the voluntary, anonymous submission of a Perceived Stress       Scale, a validated survey tool to determine an individual''s perceived stress level.       Participants will be healthcare workers and hospital staff in the Mount Sinai Hospital       system.

A hallmark of severe COVID-19 disease is immune system       dysregulation called cytokine storm. Multiple studies have reported that patients with severe       disease demonstrate elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines early in disease, and       elevated IL-6 plasma concentrations are predictive of poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19.       Disulfiram, an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of alcohol dependence disorder is an       appealing therapeutic option for COVID-19. It has a good safety profile, easy dosing       schedule, and recent data suggesting multiple mechanisms by which disulfiram may act on       COVID-19 (both as a direct antiviral agent as well as indirect effects on reducing       inflammation). In addition disulfiram has been studied extensively with detailed available       pharmacokinetic data; disulfiram has a short half-life ~7.5 hours with >90% of drug       eliminated within 3 days post-dose, allowing quick reversal of any potential adverse effects.       This is a randomized, placebo-controlled assessment of disulfiram in people with early       mild-to-moderate symptomatic COVID-19. Disulfiram 2 grams or a placebo will be administered       orally once daily for 3 consecutive days. Sixty (N=30 mild, N= moderate/severe) symptomatic       COVID PCR+ participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive active drug versus placebo.       Subsequent stratified analyses will be performed based on upper limit of normal hs-CRP,       ferritin, D-dimer levels. Drug/placebo will be administered using strict infection control       protocols designed to support the study of people with acute COVID-19 infection per the       Center for Diseases Control (CDC) guidelines       (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html).     ","       Disulfiram a safe, easily dosed, FDA-approved drug for the treatment of alcohol dependence       has been identified to be a potential therapeutic target for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Disulfiram       may have both antiviral (inhibiting viral replication via blocking the Mpro protease and zinc       ejection) and anti-inflammatory effects (via inhibition of NF-kB-induced and NLRP       inflammasome-induced cytokine release) on SARS-CoV-2. We will test disulfiram 2000 mg/day for       3 consecutive days (doses shown to be well tolerated and safe in a recent phase 2b trial) in       60 symptomatic COVID PCR+ individuals in a randomized (1:1) clinical trial evaluating the       effect on COVID symptoms severity, SARS-CoV-2 viral load, and biomarkers of inflammation over       31 days.

COVID-19 has been associated with a hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable state,       leading to a range of thromboembolic complications from pulmonary embolism to ischemic       stroke. Furthermore, emerging data suggest that the associated acute respiratory failure is,       at least in part, due to pulmonary vascular disease caused by micro- and/or macro-emboli,       creating pulmonary vascular shunting and dead-space ventilation. In this placebo-controlled,       double blind, randomized, Phase II dose escalation study, we plan to evaluate the clinical       efficacy and safety of low-dose IV bolus tenecteplase together with anticoagulation compared       with control patients on therapeutic anticoagulation alone in hospitalized adults diagnosed       with COVID-19 respiratory failure with elevated D-dimer.

An interim futility analysis will be conducted after       16 evaluable patients have received the ultralow dose-whole lung radiation therapy       (ULD-WLRT). If at least 3 patients survive for at least 30 days, we will enroll additional 8       patients (total of 24 patients). Otherwise, the trial will stop for further evaluation. Due       to the limited data currently available in local institutions about a 30 day mortality rate ,       we will retrospectively evaluate the mortality rate of the ventilated patients without the       ULD-WLRT in our institution when data is available.       Time to event secondary objectives (e.g. overall survival, time to discharge) analyses will       be performed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, with a competing risk model (leaving the       study because of death), including effects for demographic/clinical characteristics in the       model.

","       Low doses of radiation in the form of chest X-rays have been used to treat people with       pneumonia. This treatment was found to be effective by reducing inflammation and with minimal       side effects. However, it was an expensive treatment and was eventually replaced with less       costly treatments such as antibiotics. Radiation has also been shown in some animal       experiments to reduce some types of inflammation.       Some patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia will experience worsening disease, which can       become very serious, requiring the use of a ventilator. This is caused by inflammation in the       lung from the virus and the immune system. For this study, the x-ray given is called       radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-ray beams from a large machine to       target the lungs and reduce inflammation. Usually, it is given at much higher doses to treat       cancers.       The purpose of this study is to find out if adding a single treatment of low-dose x-rays to       the lungs might reduce the amount of inflammation in the lungs from a COVID-19 infection,       which could help a patient to breathe without use of a ventilator.

The device       will be used as indicated (for warming). Patient temperature measurement will be collected       for both the core warming and standard of care arms during the study period (72 hours).       Core warming will be performed using standard technique per instructions for use for the       esophageal heat transfer device. The esophageal heat transfer device will be set to 42°C       temperature after initial placement, and maintained at 42°C for the duration of treatment. It       is expected that patient temperature will increase from baseline by 1°C to 2°C, but due to       ongoing heat loss from the patient, the expected maximum patient temperature is below 39°C.       The time course of illness of COVID-19 is such that most patients no longer have fever by the       time of mechanical ventilation. If patient temperature increases above this range and reaches       39.8°C, the device will be set to an operating temperature of 40°C, thereby preventing any       further increase in patient temperature (ambient heat loss precludes patient from reaching       device operating temperature).       Control group patients will be managed as per standard of care currently utilized in the ICU,       which will include the use of other methods of temperature management as warranted. This       would include warming with a forced air blanket only in hypothermic patients (core       temperature < 36°C) or antipyretic therapy for febrile patients, as requested by the treating       physician. Episodes of hypothermia are infrequent and transient in this population, and the       current standard of care generally utilizes a permissive approach to fever (allowing patients       to remain mildly febrile) which will continue in the control group without modification (no       intentional elevation of temperature will be provided in the control group).       Follow up data will be collected at 1 month following enrollment.     ","       This is a small scale pilot study to evaluate if core warming improves respiratory physiology       of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19, allowing earlier weaning from ventilation,       and greater overall survival.

Research shows that COVID-19 reduces levels of angiotensin-converting       enzyme-2 (ACE-2), an enzyme that converts angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7 (known as       TXA127). COVID-19 reduces levels of ACE-2 and therefore angiotensin 1-7 and as a result,       angiotensin II levels are going to be increased. Many clinical observations in COVID-19 have       shown the high incidence of acute kidney injury that may be due to excessive levels of       angiotensin II. The investigators hypothesize that administration of angiotensin (1-7)       replaces levels of ACE-2 in COVID-19 and thereby ameliorates deterioration of multi-organ       failure and specifically acute kidney injury.     ",       The purpose of this study is to determine if administration of angiotensin-(1-7) (TXA127)       prevents acute kidney injury and deterioration into multi-organ failure in patients with       severe COVID-19.

To       effectively respond to the COVID-19 outbreak, various governments have implemented rapid and       comprehensive public health emergency interventions that include social restrictions and       quarantines, which is the separation and restriction of movement of people who might have       been exposed to the virus. While the physical risk (e.g. pneumonia, respiratory breakdown) is       getting the most scientific and clinical attention, this outbreak also has significant mental       health risks and extreme psychological fear-related responses. Psychological responses to       previous large-scale outbreaks, particularly to the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) epidemic during       2014-2016, provide insight into the potential impact of rapidly spreading diseases on mental       health problems. During the Ebola outbreak, fear-related behaviors such as stigmatizing       infected survivors and ignoring medical procedures impeded public health efforts and       negatively affected the recovery of survivors (2). Anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder       (PTSD), and depression were found in nearly half of the EVD survivors and their contacts.       The COVID-19 outbreak exceeds the scope and magnitude of most previous disasters over the       last 100 years. It entails a blend of risk factors for both acute and long-term mental health       problems. Data that is started to emerge from the COVID-19 outbreak, suggest that front lines       health workers (doctors; nurses) are particularly at risk. A recent study (3) in 1257 health       care workers from 34 hospitals, conducted between January 29 to February 3, 2020, revealed       that more than half (50.4%) of the health workers were screened positive for depression,       44.6% for anxiety, and 34.0% for insomnia. Consistent with previous disaster studies (4) a       dose-response relationship was found between the level of exposure and outcomes. Others may       develop a moral injury, profound psychological distress which results in actions, or the lack       of them, which violet one''s moral or ethical code (5,6). Given the magnitude of the COVID-19       outbreak, its risk to physical and mental health, an effective and timely response is       essential to address the psychosocial needs associated with the ongoing exposure to disease,       death, and distress among health care providers, across low and high risks areas.       Many health care providers reluctant to seek support from friends and family, as well as       mental health care due to stigma and fear (e.g., it would be too embarrassing, I would be       seen as week)(4). Despite enduring symptoms, they may wait months to years before they seek       help (7). Among reasons to avoid seeking mental health care, individuals report mistrust in       mental health providers, being seen as weak or stereotyped as crazy, and a belief that they       may be responsible for having mental health problems (8,9). Applying strategies to reduce       stigma and fear towards mental health care and improve help-seeking behavior may ameliorate       impaired functioning and reduce risks for long-term psychiatric illness.       Previous studies have shown that social contact is the most effective type of intervention to       reduce stigma- related attitudes and to improve help-seeking behavior. Social contact       involves interpersonal contact with members of the stigmatized group: members of the general       public who meet and interact with individuals who suffer from stress, fear, depression, or       anxiety and seek mental health care, are likely to lessen their stigma. Corrigan has       identified the most important ingredients of contact-based programs: an empowered presenter       with lived experience who attains his/her goals (e.g., I was able to fight the       depression/distress that I had following the COVID-19). While both direct, in-person social       contact and indirect, video-based social contact have effectively improved attitudes toward       mental issues and care, the latter can be implemented on a larger scale, use a minimal       resource and easily disseminated.     ","       The overarching goal of this study is to examine the efficacy of a brief video intervention       in reducing stigma and fear, and improving help-seeking behavior, among health care providers       (N=1,200), with pre- post- and follow-up assessments (at day 14 and day 30). Participants       will be recruited via Amazon Turk and randomly assigned to either a) a video-based       intervention (day 1 and a booster intervention of the same content on day 14 of the study)       featuring the personal story of a health care provider during COVID-19 pandemic, his/her       struggles and barriers to care, (b) video-based intervention (day 1 only), and a written       description of the same story on day 14 (c) no-intervention control arm (questionnaires       only).       The invetsigators aim to (1) determine whether video-based intervention reduce stigma and       fear, and increase help-seeking behavior in relation to COVID-19 among health care providers,       and (2) compare high-risk areas (e.g., NY) to low-risk areas (e.g., Montana) on intervention       outcomes, and (3) test whether symptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD and Moral Injury       (measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7),       the Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5 (PC-PTSD-5) and the Moral Injury Events Scale (MIES))       would change over time.

It is anticipated that the early initiation of p38α/β inhibitor therapy in patients with       moderate COVID-19 will prevent further clinical deterioration and reduce the need for both       increased respiratory support as well as mortality. This is the main hypothesis for this       study.       To address this hypothesis, Fulcrum Therapeutics is conducting a Phase 3, multicenter,       randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that will evaluate the safety and efficacy       of losmapimod versus placebo in subjects with COVID-19 disease.       Losmapimod is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of facioscapulohumeral       dystrophy (FSHD) and has previously been administered to more than 3600 adult healthy       volunteers and subjects including participants in a large Phase 3 trial which looked at       clinical outcomes and safety after major cardiovascular events.       Patients will participate in this study for approximately 34 days. The total treatment       duration will be 14 days. Subjects will be evaluated during a 3 day pre-treatment period       (Screening and Baseline Visits) to establish pre-treatment baseline assessments and       eligibility. Subjects will then be randomized to treatment with losmapimod or placebo for 14       days and assessed frequently for changes from pre-treatment in various clinical outcome       assessments. Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 by viral PCR prior to       randomization and first dosing. Patients will receive 15 mg of losmapimod, or placebo twice       daily given as two 7.5 mg tablets per dose by mouth: for a total of 4 pills or 30 mg daily       for 14 consecutive days. All study visits during the first week of treatment are anticipated       to be conducted in the inpatient setting while later visits are anticipated to be conducted       as outpatient.       The primary endpoint of the study is to assess the efficacy of losmapimod tablets compared       with placebo for the treatment of COVID-19 when administered concurrently with the local       standard of care. Secondary endpoints include evaluating the effect of losmapimod compared       with placebo on clinical outcomes, clinical status, effect on survival, safety, and       tolerability and to characterize changes in the levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection.     ","       The therapeutic hypothesis for the use of losmapimod in COVID-19 disease is that increased       mortality and severe disease is caused by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase       (MAPK)-mediated exaggerated acute inflammatory response resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection.       The study Sponsor hypothesize''s that the early initiation of p38α/β inhibitor therapy in       patients hospitalized with moderate COVID-19 who are at increased risk of a poor prognosis       based on older age and elevated systemic inflammation will reduce clinical deterioration       including progression to respiratory failure and death.

These studies are designed to       assess risk of healthcare workers during outbreaks of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) also known       as sudden acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This will be a prospective,       single-center observational study involving human subjects. IgG (Immunoglobulin G) antibody       will be tested in the serum of physicians working at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital       (ALGH). IgG antibodies are the antibodies that form in response to viral or bacterial       infections and typically reflect protection against said infection. To date, there have been       no studies confirming that IgG antibody formation confers immunity, but studies are ongoing.       Furthermore, data is lacking showing conclusive persistence of (possibly protective)       antibodies over time. Attending physicians on the medical staff, fellow physicians, and house       staff residents who worked at ALGH from March 1st, 2020 and on, will be eligible for the       study. Testing will involve a venipuncture to obtain approximately 3mL of blood to be sent to       ACL Laboratories for SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing. For physician subjects, this will be performed       on four separate occasions, once at the onset of the study, a second test 3 months after the       first test, a third test 6 months from the time of the first test, and a fourth and final       test 12 months after the initial test. Two household members (defined below), one-time       testing will occur within 2 weeks of the physician subject testing positive. All testing will       be performed in a two-week window. All physician subjects will be tested at a centralized       site that is only serving these subjects, by appointment.

What is the subject''s overall impression of mental health services (choices ranging from            very unhelpful to very helpful)       Subjects will be asked to complete the 1) Critical Care Family Needs Inventory (CCFNI)       questionnaire, 2) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and 3) Impact of Events Scale       Revised (IES-R) questionnaire.       Subjects will participate in a 30-minute phone interview with a psychologist. The       psychologist will review the subject''s responses to the above surveys and ask follow-up       questions. The psychologist will ask how the subject has been coping with any psychological       symptoms (i.e. anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress)       The psychologist will describe different types of interventions for people coping       psychological symptoms and assess the subject''s interest in pursuing any of them.       The investigators will not begin Part 2 until 10 subjects have completed Part 1- Post-ICU       discharge survey and Interview. The investigators will review survey responses and interview       transcripts for the first 10 subjects. Based on responses the investigators will determine       the type(s) of support interventions that will be offered for subjects in this study. An       amendment to the study protocol will be made at this time.       Part 2 - Post-ICU psychological intervention Subjects with clinically significant       psychologist symptoms based on either their survey or interview responses will be invited to       participate in 6-week trauma-focused intervention with a psychologist. The intervention will       be individualized to the needs of the subject. It will involve 30-60 minute sessions up to       once per week conducted by phone or video call.       At the completion of the intervention, surrogates will complete the 1) Hospital Anxiety and       Depression Scale (HADS), and 2) Impact of Events Scale Revised (IES-R) questionnaire.       Subjects will participate in another 30-minute phone interview with a psychologist. The       psychologist will review the subject''s responses to the above surveys and ask follow-up       questions. The psychologist will ask how the subject has been coping with any psychological       symptoms (i.e. anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress).       All interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed. Two members study staff will review       the transcriptions and use thematic content analysis to determine the types of psychological       symptoms that are present and the reason(s) they may be present.       When analyzing subject responses, the investigators will account for the following variables         -  Whether the patient is deceased or not         -  Length of time since hospital discharge         -  Whether the subject received mental health services on their own or not         -  Whether the subject received daily written summaries in the ICU or not       Statistical Analysis The investigators expect ~100 subjects to meet inclusion criteria. The       investigators expect ~70-100 to complete Part 1 (Post-ICU discharge survey and Interview).       The investigators will determine the prevalence of psychological symptoms and opinions on ICU       care by reviewing survey responses and interview recordings. The investigators expect ~30 to       complete Part 2 (Post-ICU discharge survey and Interview). The investigators compare pre- to       post-intervention survey responses for each subject using a paired t-test. Part 2 will be       considered a pilot study. The investigators will use the results to plan a future, adequately       powered study.     ",       Families of patients in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) are at increased risk for developing       psychological symptoms that can last for months after the patient is discharged. These       symptoms can have significant impact on both the patient and family member's quality of life.       The investigators have found that families of patients admitted to the Rush University       Medical Center ICU during to the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely to develop clinically       significant psychological symptoms than families of patients admitted prior to the COVID-19       pandemic. The investigators suspect that this finding is due in part to the hospital-wide no       visitation policy that altered our standard communication practices and may have prevented       families from being active participants in the patient's medical care.       The goals of this project are 1) to determine the prevalence of psychological disorders among       families of COVID-19 patients after ICU discharge 2) to determine the characteristics of ICU       care that were associated with the development of psychological disorders among family       members and 3) to pilot a program in which families with psychological disorders after ICU       discharge receive therapy from mental health professionals.     ,Score on Impact of Events Scale Revised (IES-R) questionnaire. 22 questions.

However, for some people elevated state anxiety transitions to anxiety disorders, creating       undue suffering and impairment. Nearly 33% of both Wuhan residents and Chinese citizens       screened positive for generalized anxiety disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic, with       uncontrollable, persistent COVID-19-related worries strongly predicting presence of GAD.       Similarly, large surveys indicate that levels of anxiety symptoms are rising among United       States citizens.       This finding aligns with a large body of literature indicating stronger perceived control       over one''s own anxiety buffers against a variety of anxiety disorders. Thus, in the context       of COVID-19, there is a pressing need for materials that might strengthen perceived control       over anxiety, thereby reducing risk for anxiety disorder onset. Ideally, such materials would       (1) in no way undermine positive health behaviors, like social distancing, and (2) have       capacity for broad-scale, immediate accessibility. Internet-based interventions may       particularly valuable during the pandemic stage of COVID-19 due to the need for social       distancing, and they have already scaled up to address needs in China. However, drop out from       internet-based interventions can be up to 83% and intervention engagement is a frequent       issue. Fortunately, single-session experiences (SSEs) can improve mental health related       outcomes with similar effect sizes as multi-session therapies, and pilot data from our team       suggests they can increase general perceived control (within-group dz = 0.70).       The goal of this project is to test a web-based platform where people can confidentially       access and provide feedback on brief activities, called ''single-session experiences'' (SSEs),       which are about 8 minutes in length, entirely self-administered, and computer-based (Contain       COVID Anxiety and Project Remain COVID Free). Previous activities following the same best       practices as these experiences have been shown to be safe to complete; predicted significant       reductions in psychological distress; and are entirely self-administered. We will recruit a       weighted-probability sample of the United States through Prolific''s online platform, N = 500.       All data collected from the SSEs will be confidential, and the only identifiable information       that will be recorded is the participants'' Prolific ID to facilitate compensation, which will       be deleted from the data after the compensation has been paid. Those that choose to complete       the activities have the option to submit their advice to their peers and have it posted       anonymously to the web-based platform. This will provide people with an option for an easily       accessible activity designed to promote healthy coping skills and resilience in a welcoming       environment through which they can learn with others and share experiences.     ","       The goal of this study is to test whether an online, self-administered SSI designed to       strengthen perceived control over anxiety in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic (Contain       COVID Anxiety) increases perceived control over anxiety more than a placebo,       hand-washing-plan SSI (Remain COVID Free) in a weighted-probability sample of the United       States (N = 500).

The study is designed to transition from phase 2 to phase 3 in the same trial, with or       without a pause in enrollment, depending on the speed of enrollment and interim results. For       promising agents with limited availability, a phase 3 evaluation may occur at a later time.       Up to two dose levels of the same agent may be assessed. Agents may also enter directly into       phase 3 evaluation if sufficient safety and efficacy data are available from outside the       trial.

The aim of the study is to determine if inhaled sargramostim, as an adjunct to       institutional standard of care, improves clinical outcomes in patients with       COVID-19-associated acute hypoxemia. All patients on the sargramostim arm will be treated       with 125 mcg inhaled sargramostim twice daily for 5 days, in addition to institutional       standard of care.

While some of these       hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infections have included pregnant women that also require       inpatient pharmacologic anticoagulation and occasionally extended anticoagulation after       discharge, little is known about the effects of the hypercoagulable COVID-19 induced state on       the developing embryo, nor the necessary anticoagulation recommendation guidelines for these       expecting mothers.       The pregnancy related pro-thrombotic state, in addition to the COVID-19 associated       hypercoagulability may have unknown consequences to the developing fetus. Hence, this       proposal seeks to address this question that may have important implications for women that       contract this virus during gestation through the following specific aims.       Specific Aim 1: To evaluate evidence for in-utero vascular accidents that may manifest as       intestinal atresias and limb abnormalities in the first 30 days of life as well as rates of       preterm labor, fetal growth restriction and spontaneous abortions in pregnant females that       contract the SARS-CoV-2 virus during gestation.       Rationale: Pregnancy produces a hypercoagulable state, this study intends to expand on the       body of literature for COVID-19 manifestations by evaluating the additional virus-induced       hypercoagulability on the developing embryo.       Methods: A multidisciplinary approach in conjunction with maternal fetal medicine (MFM),       neonatology, and pathology, the study will identify, and recruit infants whom were exposed to       COVID-19 while in-utereo. This project will run in parallel with the institution''s COVID-19       in Pregnancy Biobank that intends to obtain needed epidemiological and clinical data linked       to biosamples to provide insight into SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women and their infants.       Specific Aim 2: To evaluate children identified in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) as       having evidence of intestinal atresias or limb anomalies for potential asymptomatic carriers       of COVID-19 that could have contracted the disease during the pregnancy.       Rationale: As high as 81% of patients that contract SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic or minimally       symptomatic during the infection period. The long-term manifestation of the virus in these       asymptomatic carriers, especially in pregnant women and their developing embryos, are       presently unknown.       Methods: Mothers of children identified will undergo SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing to identify       the possibility of asymptomatic carriers which may have occurred during the pregnancy.     ","       The pregnancy related pro-thrombotic state, in addition to the COVID-19 associated       hypercoagulability may have unknown consequences to the developing fetus.

Aging, obesity, diabetes, hypertension and other risk       factors associated with abnormal lipid and carbohydrate metabolism are risk factors for death       in COVID-19. Recent studies suggest that COVID-19 progression is dependent on metabolic       mechanisms. Moreover, gene expression analyses in cultured human bronchial cells infected       with SARS-CoV-2 and lung tissue from patients with COVID-19, indicated a marked shift in       cellular metabolism, with excessive intracellular lipid generation. In this cell culture       system, fenofibrate (a widely available low-cost generic drug approved by the FDA and       multiple other regulatory agencies around the world to treat dyslipemias) at concentrations       that can be achieved clinically, markedly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 viral replication.

Severe hypoxemia in these patients is thought to be related in part to generation       of alveolar edema. This would be related to the specific infection related injury of the       alveoli-capillary membrane, however other factors could be related to edema formation.       Although patients meet criteria for the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), there is       significant controversy about whether the lungs of the COVID-19 patients have the       characteristics of ARDS and thus whether the treatment should mimic treatment of ARDS due to       other causes. A general principle in ARDS patients is to avoid positive fluid balances as       this may contribute to alveolar edema. Also, the guidelines on the management of COVID-19       patients by the Society of Critical Care Medicine advocate a conservative fluid strategy [8].       However, uncorrected hypovolemia may result in additional organ dysfunction (especially       kidney injury). The clinical fluid status is usually estimated by the presence of peripheral       edema and daily fluid balances and thus prone to errors as these are poorly related to the       circulating blood volume. Management of patients with sepsis based on blood volume       measurements and red blood cell volume, to disclose true anemia, has been shown to improve       outcome. Finally, the transudation of albumin in the extravascular space has been shown to be       associated with outcome of critically ill patients. It is highly plausible that these       parameters could help guide the care of COVID-19 patients given the available data in the       literature, thus promoting better treatment of these patients.       This is a prospective multicenter study where the treatment team is blinded to the results of       the study.

Treatment with invasive ventilation improves oxygenation yet results in death in       over 50% of cases. The high incidence of disease has also reduced resources needed to safely       deliver invasive ventilation including mechanical ventilators and intravenous sedation.       Non-invasive respiratory support has been shown to be efficacious in acute hypoxemic       respiratory failure from other etiologies and has the potential to reduce rates of intubation       and the time spent on mechanical ventilation in COVID-19. However, it is unknown which type       of support is the most effective, limiting the ability to improve clinical outcomes and       appropriately allocate resources. To help guide clinical practice and policy, it is critical       to understand the comparative effectiveness of two forms of non-invasive respiratory support       used worldwide, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) delivered via a helmet interface       and high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO).

NCT04531618,2020-08-13,Recruiting,N/A,Interventional,Mother-infant Bonding During COVID-19,Promoting Mother-Infant Emotional Connection During the COVID-19 Pandemic: an Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) of Virtual Family Nurture Intervention,COVID-19|Child Development|Mother-Infant Interaction,Family Nurture Intervention (FNI),All,,0,Accepts Healthy Volunteers,10032,Prevention,Randomized,Parallel Assignment,,None (Open Label),"       Mother-infant interactions, which are well-established to strongly influence long-term       neurodevelopmental outcomes, are at particular risk during the pandemic, both due to maternal       stress, as well as to changes in health care policies leading to decreased interaction with       healthcare providers during the immediate postpartum period. In order to minimize risk of       severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 transmission, nurses and physicians in the WBN       have minimized entry and exit into patient rooms, and new moms are discharged on average one       day early. In addition to psychological stress, there are also currently unknown risks to the       neonates born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infections at various points in their pregnancy.       Although viral transmission itself seems unlikely, it is currently completely unknown if       secondary effects will be observed. In the case of maternal HIV infection, it is now well       established that even when vertical transmission does not occur, there are negative       consequences to neurodevelopmental outcomes of these exposed children. It is therefore       imperative to develop preventative strategies that protect newborns and set them on the path       of optimal neurodevelopment. As mother-infant nurturing interactions are known to be the most       crucial ingredient in optimal neurodevelopmental trajectories, the goal of the investigators       is to test the hypothesis that an intervention focused on promoting mother-infant emotional       connection in the neonatal period will lead to long-term benefit and prevention of       deleterious effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The investigators will use FNI, an intervention       specifically developed to enhance mother-infant emotional connection through facilitated       mother-infant interactions, emotional exchanges and mutual calming sessions. Some of the       facilitated interactions include: interactive touch with deep emotional expression and vocal       soothing, sustained reciprocal olfactory exposure, family practice in comforting, and       skin-to-skin holding. Previously at CUIMC, an RCT investigated the effects of FNI in NICU       infants. Infants who received FNI showed significant increases in electroencephalogram (EEG)       power, a measure of brain activity, near term age compared with those who receive Standard       Care (SC). Increased EEG power has previously been shown to be associated with improved       cognitive development, as measured by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development       (BSID-III). Within the group of children who scored above 85 on the Bayley-III (1 standard       deviation below the mean or higher), FNI infants scored significantly higher on the BSID-III       Cognitive and Language scales compared to SC infants. Additionally, FNI infants had lower       risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as measured by the Modified Checklist of Autism for       Toddlers (M-CHAT), an early ASD screening questionnaire. FNI infants also displayed       significantly lower levels of EEG coherence (1-18 Hz) largely within and between frontal       regions. This finding suggests that FNI may accelerate brain maturation particularly in       frontal brain regions, which are involved in regulation of attention, cognition, and emotion.       Taken together, the first RCT of FNI is strongly suggestive of neurodevelopmental benefit.       Purpose/aims: The COVID-19 pandemic has made precautions necessary in the Well Baby Nursery       that result in maternal stress which is known to impair mother-infant bonding, which is       well-established to be critical for positive long-term neurodevelopmental and behavioral       outcomes. The investigators will be conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Family       Nurture Intervention (FNI) in the Morgan Stanley Children''s Hospital (MSCH) Well Baby Nursery       (WBN) at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC). The RCT will compare       neurodevelopmental and socio-emotional outcomes of the current standard of care (SC) during       the COVID-19 pandemic with Family Nurture Intervention (FNI) conducted via telemedicine.     ","       The purpose of this study is to compare the mother-infant emotional connection formed during       the pandemic in standard care (SC) versus Family Nurture Intervention (FNI) pairs, an       evidence-based intervention designed to counteract the adverse effects of maternal-infant       disconnection. In prior research on preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit       (NICU), FNI participants demonstrated increased quality of maternal caregiving behaviors and       significant improvements in premature infants'' neurodevelopment across multiple domains,       including social-relatedness and attention problems. Goals of FNI include assisting mothers       in providing appropriate types of stimulation for their babies that are important for social,       emotional, and neurobehavioral development as well as reducing stress physiology in both       mother and infant. Data gathered in this study will help the investigators learn more about       the underlying mechanisms that take place during mother-infant interactions and examine how       these play a role in setting the infant up for the best neurodevelopmental trajectory.       Intervention will be conducted electronically both in the Well Baby Nursery (WBN) and at home       over the following 4 months. Assessments will consist of videos of mother-infant interactions       at the time of each intervention session, and pediatrician-led follow-up surveys conducted in       the linked Institutional Review Board-approved study.     ","The quality of caregiving in the domain of sensitivity versus insensitivity, will be measured on a scale from 1-9, with 9 indicating higher quality caregiving. During each Zoom call, following the mother-infant interaction video but prior to intervention for the FNI group, a recording will be obtained where mother undresses infant, changes diaper, and redresses infant. This video will be scored with an adaption of the Ainsworth System for Rating Maternal Care-Giving Behavior with measures such as sensitivity and intrusiveness.",Right and Left Frontal Mother & Infant EEG Synchrony,"Morgan Stanley Children''s Hopspital; New York; New York; 10032; Dani Dumitriu, MD, PhD; dani.dumitriu@columbia.edu; 646-774-6255","Dani Dumitriu, MD, PhD; 646-774-6255; dani.dumitriu@columbia.edu"

This acts to physically redistribute blood to       uninjured or minimally injured lung that can still participate in taking up oxygen.       Unfortunately, not all centers are equipped or trained for this maneuver which has it''s own       inherent risks. The investigators are proposing that the effects of proning can be safely       mimicked by the V/Q vest by applying pressure through a non invasive externally fitted vest.       By 4 front and rear inflatable compartments, doctors can fine tune the redirection of blood       as occurs in proning. However the vest successfully avoids the need for expensive specialized       equipment, training and facilities. In addition, preliminary assessment of the technique       using sand bags to apply pressure, the investigators found that those patients who did not       respond to this maneuver also failed to respond to more costly therapies. The vest       potentially acts as a therapy in and of itself and as an indicator of what is optimal       treatment for the COVID-19 patient while saving hospital resources and economic burden.       The study procedures will take less than 4 hours to complete for each subject enrolled.       During this time, the subject will be sedated. The ventilation perfusion vest consists of two       parts for ease of placement. The vest has multiple chambers which will be inflated to       different pressures. The vest will be inflated for 1 hour at a specific pressure and the       pressure will then be increased for a second hour, followed by one final hour at additional       increased pressure for the purpose of the study. This will help to evaluate which pressure is       optimal for altering lung function and oxygen levels.     ","       The objective of this research is optimizing oxygenation in patients in the setting of acute       hypoxic respiratory failure in relation to corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through       non-invasive manipulation as a complementary therapy to traditional advanced mechanical       ventilator support, or as a marker of responsivity to supportive therapies. The intent is to       determine if it is possible to physically improve the ability of the lungs to take up oxygen       by applying external pressure to the chest. It is hypothesized that the use of the vest for       this patient population will alter the blood flow through the lungs and thereby improve       oxygen levels in the body. Participants will wear the ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) vest for 2       hours and study activities will last up to 4 hours.     ","Improvement in oxygenation will be assessed by a demonstrated >20% increase in arterial oxygen levels after 180 minutes of treatment with the V/Q Vest, with two different levels of pressure.

The genetic       and epigenetic basis for differential susceptibility remains unknown.       Patients receiving hemodialysis provide a good opportunity to understand genetic and       epigenetic susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. By virtue of their ongoing requirements for care,       such patients cannot shelter at home or maintain social distancing, but must instead report       to a clinical care setting on a thrice weekly basis. Moreover, such patients often travel to       and from dialysis using shared ride services, which furthers opportunity for exposure.       Preliminary estimates suggest that rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity are 2 to 5-fold higher       among hemodialysis patients than in the general public. Furthermore, frequent contact with       the health care system among dialysis patients makes tracking clinical course comparatively       easy.       The purpose of this study is to collect genomic and clinical data among a cohort of       hemodialysis patients and analyze the association between genetic markers and the development       and severity of illness in response to SARS-CoV-2.

The NMDA receptor, and specifically the NR2B subunit, is       involved in glutamate signaling, and is expressed on both neutrophils and T cells. In the       case of neutrophils, activation of the NMDA receptor can (1) result in expression of CD11b       which targets neutrophils via ICAM-1 to areas of inflammation, and (2) trigger the autocrine       release of glutamate. In the case of T-cells, activation of T cells via glutamate can cause       (1) T cell proliferation and, (2) the release of cytokines. The activation of T cells and       cytokine release can be blocked in vitro by the addition of Ifenprodil. As such it could be a       potent anti-inflammatory agent.       Ifenprodil was discovered by a genome wide RNAi assay to uncover gene targets associated with       cytoprotective activity against highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza, specifically by preserving       cell viability in vitro. When tested in a murine model of H5N1, the drug at clinically       relevant doses: (1) improved survivability from 0% at day 6 to 40% day 14 post-infection, (2)       the drug significantly reduced edema and lung injury score and (3) reduced infiltrating T       cells, neutrophils and NK cells and attenuated the ''cytokine storm''. The mortality rate of       H5N1 in humans is >50%, whereas the mortality rate of COVID-19 infected patients is < 5%, and       both viruses cause acute lung injury and share similar pulmonary pathologies. NP-120 has also       been shown to mediate anti-inflammatory responses and reduce pulmonary fibrosis in a murine       model of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a complication which can occur after a respiratory       virus infection.       Based on the fact that H5N1 has a significantly higher mortality rate than COVID-19 but still       shares similar lung pathologies, Algernon Pharmaceuticals believes Ifenprodil could reduce       lung injury associated with COVID-19 infection, thereby improving lung function and       accelerating patient recovery.       The purpose of this adaptive Phase 2b/3 trial is to determine the safety and efficacy of       NP-120 in the treatment of COVID-19 infection.     ","       The purpose of this adaptive trial is to determine the clinical efficacy of Ifenprodil in the       treatment of patients infected with COVID-19. This Protocol is largely based on the       recommendations of the WHO R&D Blueprint Clinical Trials Expert Group COVID-19 Therapeutic       Trial Synopsis, and associated Master Protocol.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) axis       therapies may reduce COVID-19 mortality. Retrospective analyses of tocilizumab in severe to       critical COVID-19 patients have demonstrated survival advantage and lower likelihood of       requiring invasive ventilation following tocilizumab administration. The majority of patients       have rapid resolution (i.e., within 24-72 hours following administration) of both clinical       and biochemical signs (fever and CRP, respectively) of hyperinflammation with only a single       tocilizumab dose.       The investigators hypothesized that a dose of tocilizumab significantly lower than the EMA-       and FDA-labeled dose (8mg/kg) as well as the emerging standard of care dose (400mg) may be       effective in patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis and hyperinflammation. Advantages to the       lower dose of tocilizumab may include lower likelihood of secondary bacterial infections as       well as extension of this drug''s limited supply. The investigators conducted an adaptive       single-arm phase 2 trial (NCT04331795) evaluating clinical and biochemical response to       low-dose tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis and hyperinflammation.       This multi-center, prospective, randomized controlled phase 2 trial -- designed as two       sub-studies to allow for the possible emergence of data demonstrating the clinical efficacy       of tocilizumab 8mg/kg or 400mg -- formally tests the clinical efficacy of low-dose       tocilizumab in COVID-19 pneumonia.       Sub-Study A Primary Objective A: To establish whether low-dose tocilizumab reduces the time       to clinical recovery in patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis and hyperinflammation, when       compared to a tocilizumab-free standard of care.       Hypothesis A: The investigators hypothesize that low-dose tocilizumab, when compared to a       tocilizumab-free standard of care, decreases the time to recovery in hospitalized,       non-invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis and hyperinflammation by three       days or more.       Sub-Study B Primary Objective B: To establish whether low-dose tocilizumab is near-equivalent       to high-dose tocilizumab (400mg or 8 mg/kg) in reducing the time to clinical recovery in       patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis and hyperinflammation.       Hypothesis B: The investigators hypothesize that low-dose tocilizumab is near-equivalent to       high-dose tocilizumab in reducing the time to clinical recovery in hospitalized,       non-invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis and hyperinflammation.     ","Day of recovery is defined as the first day on which the patient achieves one of the following two categories from the seven-point ordinal scale: 6) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen or ongoing medical care or 7) Not hospitalized.

The protocol is for a randomized, blinded, controlled platform study that allows       investigational drugs to be added and dropped during the course of the study. This allows for       efficient testing of new drugs against placebo and standard of care (SOC) treatment within       the same study. When more than one drug is being tested at the same time, participants will       be randomly allocated to treatments or placebo.       This platform study involves 2 stages. In stage 1, safety will be evaluated and two       intermediate outcomes will be assessed to determine whether a drug advances to stage 2.       Treatments considered to have demonstrated unacceptable risks relative to benefits, or those       which do not reach the effectiveness threshold for the stage 1 intermediate outcomes, will       not advance to stage 2. In some cases, stage 1 may include 2 or 3 doses of the same       investigational drug, which will be considered separate drugs for the purpose of the study.       Investigational drugs with reasonably well-established safety profiles and evidence of       effectiveness (i.e. at least equivalent to the criteria for advancement of a drug from stage       1 to stage 2) may enter the study directly at stage 2. Conversely, for drugs with minimal       pre-existing safety evidence, the pace of stage 1 will initially be restricted and there will       be an early review of safety data by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).

There is no current vaccine strategy against COVID-19       infection caused by a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. Studies with a related coronavirus       called SARS-CoV-1 that caused the SARS outbreak in 2003 indicated that memory CD8+ T cells       recognizing viral epitopes persisted for more than 6 years post infection while neutralizing       antibodies and memory B cells were short-lived and were undetectable after a short period of       time (Tang et al., 2011; Peng et al., 2006; Channappanavar et al., 2014). Thus, including       viral epitopes that are recognized by memory CD8+ T cells is imperative for vaccines that can       provide long-term immunity against SARS-CoV-2. In this study, blood samples from COVID-19       patients who have recovered from the infection will be used to identify the viral epitopes       recognized by their memory CD8+ T cells. This will be accomplished using a genome-wide,       high-throughput screening technology developed at Harvard Medical School (Kula et al., 2019)       and licensed by the study sponsor, TScan Therapeutics. A 24,000-member library that tiles       across all ~100 viral isolates of SARS-CoV-2 that have been sequenced so far has already been       synthesized at TScan. Blood samples from convalescent patients are urgently needed to       identify T cell receptors and immunogenic viral epitopes on SARS-CoV-2. It is the hope that       these data will inform development of a vaccine with the potential for long-lasting       protection against SARS-CoV-2.

Subjects will be screened during admission to hospital. Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2       infection, and meeting all other inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be randomized to       either Colchicine+Rosuvastatin treatment or SOC for the duration of hospitalization. SOC will       be guided by the YNHH SARS-CoV-2 Therapeutics Group. In cases where patients require       randomization in another trial evaluating an experimental drug, they will continue on study       drug. Patients will be assessed daily while hospitalized for clinical, biomarker, safety, and       laboratory parameters based on SOC.       Colchicine is an extensively studied oral anti-inflammatory agent with a well-defined safety       profile. Colchicine, by inhibiting tubulin polymerization and clathrin-mediated endocytosis       has the potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. In addition, colchicine has a direct       anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome activation which in turn has       the potential to reduce the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm. Statins also have direct       anti-inflammatory effects by reducing chemokine release, adhesion molecules, and modulating T       cell activity and have the potential to prevent SARS-CoV-2 related endothelial dysfunction       and may reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19. Rosuvastatin, in       particular, appears to have direct antiviral properties by binding and inhibiting the active       site of the main protease enzyme (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2.1       The combination Colchicine + Rosuvastatin may have a synergetic effect to antagonize       SARS-CoV-2 infection, modulate the inflammatory response and to reduce morbidity and       mortality associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and myocardial injury in       COVID-19 patients.       Both drugs have been in use for decades for gout and pericarditis (colchicine) and       hyperlipidemia, coronary disease (CAD) and diabetes (rosuvastatin/Crestor), and have been       tested in thousands of patients used individually and in combination with a low and well       characterized risk profile. Colchicine and rosuvastatin are currently used as standard of       care in COVID-19 patients whether due to pre-existing CAD, gout or pericarditis or acute       presentations with acute coronary syndromes or acute gout with no expected added risk in the       population being studied.       This study is not intended to support a labeling change or advertising claim for either drug,       and the study will be conducted in compliance with the requirements of Yale University''s IRB       review and a research IND.       Subjects will be screened within 48 hours of hospital admission. Patients with real-time       reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and       meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be randomized to either Colchicine +       Rosuvastatin treatment in addition to SOC or SOC alone for the duration of hospitalization.       Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to one of two arms:       Active treatment:       In addition to SOC* subjects randomized to active treatment will receive:         -  Rosuvastatin: 40mg daily AND         -  Colchicine: 0.6mg twice daily for 3 days then 0.6mg daily Note: Dose adjustment based on            medical conditions and drug interactions (see section §7.4.1). Subjects previously on            chronic statin therapy will be eligible for enrollment in the trial, and if randomized            to active treatment, chronic statin therapy will be discontinued and replaced by            rosuvastatin 40 mg for 30 days or hospital discharge and resumed thereafter.       Standard of Care Controls:       Subjects will undergo SOC treatment determined by the primary care team and the YNHH       treatment algorithm for hospitalized patients with COVID-19.       *All standard of care treatments for hospitalized subjects with SARS-CoV-2 are permitted       concurrently with the study intervention. This only includes treatments approved by the Yale       SOC treatment Committee. Concomitant therapy will be performed according to standard       practice, local standards of care and published guidelines. Subjects will not be permitted to       participate in other investigational studies. Methods for identifying drug interactions and       dose adjustment are listed in section §7.4.1 of the protocol.

By leveraging the       capabilities of the Caption AI which is designed to train novice users on how to acquire TTE,       this would minimize the risk of sonographers to be exposed to COVID-19. Additionally,       minimizing sonographer interaction with patients being evaluated for or positive for COVID 19       minimizes the risk of sonographers as vectors for transmission to other patients. Lastly,       since the Caption AI device will be dedicated to the COVID wards and COVID ICU and not       transported to other locations, use of the CAPTION AI device will help to limit viral       transmission via the surfaces of the ultrasound machine.

African Americans and nursing home residents who       contract SARS-CoV-2, the novel virus that first appeared in Wuhan, China, and who develop the       disease designated COVID-19 experience a much worse clinical outcome than other groups. Some       have speculated that low vitD status could exacerbate COVID-19 infection, especially if the       viral infection reaches the lower respiratory tract.       Sufficient vitD may help to improve the pulmonary immune response to the virus, reduce the       dangerous cytokine storm, and lessen surfactant dysregulation, potentially preventing or       ameliorating the acute syndrome. To maximize the benefits of vitD on host response to       SARS-CoV-2, prophylactic supplementation to ensure sufficiency before COVID-19 would be the       preferable public health option. Yet, vitD supplementation during acute infection may also       improve overall clinical outcome in some infected patients. It is a relatively inexpensive       therapy that has a large safety profile when given in doses of 4000-6000 international       units/day to adults.       To date, there is no effective cure or preventive vaccine for COVID-19. Given the risk of       disease and death, any intervention that reduces the morbidity and mortality from COVID-19       would be of immense value. We hypothesize that achieving and sustaining vitD sufficiency       through dietary supplementation will result in improved immune function and a decrease in       COVID-19 incidence and symptomatology. Importantly, this objective will address the       significant health disparity of vitD deficiency among black, Latina and the elderly. We       further hypothesize that those individuals with a circulating 25(OH)D of ≥40 ng/mL will have       less severe COVID-19 symptoms, particularly among higher risk populations. We will compare       the effectiveness of higher dose vitD vs. standard of care dosing.To test these hypotheses,       we propose the following Aims:         1. Focusing on prevention, this Aim will test whether achieving vitD sufficiency (as            defined by total circulating 25(OH)D ≥40-60 ng/mL) in individuals at risk for deficiency            will improve clinical outcomes in those who subsequently develop COVID-19.         2. Focusing on vitD as mitigation therapy, this Aim will evaluate the effectiveness of            bolus dosing followed by daily vitD supplementation in achieving the target 25(OH)D            range of ≥40-60 ng/mL in those individuals testing positive for COVID-19 at            MUSC/affiliated hospital facilities, but do not require admission to a hospital            (outpatient) and will examine whether achieving this target range is associated with            less severe COVID-19 and differences in inflammatory cytokine profiles.       In the prevention arm of this project (Aim 1), individuals at higher risk ≥50 years of age       who test negative for COVID-19 at MUSC/its affiliate hospitals, and agree to daily vitD       supplementation for a 12-month period, with vitD status measured monthly will be randomized       to placebo or prescribed vitD (6000 IU/day) to achieve a total circulating 25(OH)       concentration of ≥40-60 ng/mL. We will compare study groups regarding subsequent infection       with COVID-19, severity of symptoms, need and duration of hospitalization (LOS), admission to       the ICU, need for ventilatory support, and mortality, along with return to baseline       activities and/or work, as a function of age, BMI, and other recognized COVID-19 risk       factors. In the mitigation arm of this project (Aim 2), non-hospitalized individuals ≥50       years of age who test COVID-19 positive will be randomized to placebo or a bolus of oral vitD       (20,000 IU X 3 days) followed by 6000 IU vitD/day, and we will compare study groups on       measures of disease severity as in Aim 1. All participants in both Aims 1 and 2 will receive       a daily multivitamin (MVI) containing 800 IU VitD for the 12-month period.       Following the completion of these Aims, we will be able to answer the following questions:         1. Are individuals with vitD deficiency more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19            infection?         2. Does being vitD replete make a person more likely to have asymptomatic COVID-19?         3. Does vitD sufficiency status account for why African Americans, Latina, and the elderly            more likely to experience complications related to COVID-19?         4. Is vitD deficiency in COVID-19 positive outpatients associated with increased severity            of symptoms and differences in inflammatory cytokine profiles that is mitigated by bolus            and then sustained vitD supplementation?       The long-term impact of these studies will influence public policy regarding more widespread       vitD supplementation is a means of reducing the severity of COVID-19. Given its low cost and       the ease with which widespread supplementation could be instituted, oral vitD supplementation       may represent a rapid and inexpensive means by which to reduce both the COVID-19 incidence       and severity.     ","       The purpose of this study is to evaluate how useful vitamin D supplementation is in reducing       the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and the body''s inflammatory and infection-fighting response       to COVID-19. Individuals ≥50 years of age and older who are tested for COVID-19 and negative       will be randomized (like flipping a coin) to either daily high dose vitamin D supplementation       (6000 IU vitamin D3/day) vs. standard of care.

Any critically ill patient with known or presumed COVID-19 will be automatically       entered into the screening phase of the trial until SARS-CoV-2 infection is confirmed. Basic       data will be assembled for each patient (such as ventilatory status and survival). All       patients who start high-flow oxygen (WHO COVID-19 level 5; > 6L oxygen by nasal prongs or       mask) will be entered in an observational registry which will only require extraction of       medical record data. Registry participants will be asked to sign a consent form for the       backbone treatment and a specific investigational agent arm to which they are assigned. The       primary endpoint will be time to recover to a durable level 4 (or less) on the WHO COVID-19       ordinal scale for clinical improvement. For this trial, a durable level 4 is defined as at       least 48 hours at COVID level 4 or less (nasal prongs oxygen) without returning to high flow       oxygen or intubation. Acute care facility resource utilization will be automatically       calculated (total length of stay in a critical care setting, days intubated, and survival).       Any change in status, including intubation, extubation, death or discharge, will be recorded       and verified by the attending physician.       Patients will be evaluated based on their initial status (ventilation at entry vs. high flow       oxygen). Exploratory biomarkers will be evaluated over time (ARDS phenotypes and other       proposed markers) to facilitate clinical learning. The trial will begin enrollment with two       investigational agents and quickly increase to four study arms as the pace of enrollment       increases. The anticipated accrual will be 50 patients per week. The maximum number of       participants assigned to an arm without graduation will be 125 patients. Agents can be       dropped for futility after enrollment of 50 patients. It is anticipated that 10       investigational agents can be evaluated in the span of 4-6 months, depending on the time       course of COVID-19 infections across the US. As the trial proceeds and a better understanding       of the underlying mechanisms of the COVID-19 illness emerges, expanded biomarker and data       collection can be added as needed to further elucidate how agents are or are not working. The       study design features comparison of investigational agent efficacy using a Bayesian design,       which will allow the detection of strong efficacy signals with the fewest possible patients.       Initially the control will be patients given current standard of care (supportive care for       ARDS, including lung protective ventilation and remdesivir as backbone therapy). As other       treatments (for example, anticoagulation) become part of standard supportive care across       sites, these will be added to the backbone therapy. If an agent meets the threshold for       graduation the company leadership will be informed as will the FDA. The arm with the       graduated agent will cease to enroll, allowing a new arm with a different investigational       agent to be added. Information about agents disposition will be as follows:       Every trial participant will have blood collected at trial enrollment, day 3, and day 7 for       pre-specified biomarker and DNA and RNA analysis. Additional biomarkers can be added as the       trial proceeds. Patient outcomes will also be evaluated on the basis of whether patients are       ventilated initially or not.     ","       The goal of this project is to rapidly screen promising agents, in the setting of an adaptive       platform trial, for treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients. In this phase 2 platform       design, agents will be identified with a signal suggesting a big impact on reducing mortality       and the need for, as well as duration, of mechanical ventilation.

In preclinical models, MSC are effective in ameliorating acute lung injury due to their       ability to secrete paracrine factors that regulate lung endothelial and epithelial       permeability, including growth factors, anti-inflammatory cytokines, and antimicrobial       peptides. Based on the promising pre-clinical preliminary data and intriguing results in       patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia and ARDS as well as an established safety profile       of MSC generally and in ARDS in particular, the researchers propose multiple dosing of MSCs       as a study treatment to ameliorate the severity and duration of SARS-CoV-2 associated       pneumonia and ARDS potentially improve survival.       Patients will receive study agent (MSC or placebo) within 48 hours of enrollment. Three doses       will be administered unless a severe infusion adverse event occurs that is related to the MSC       infusion.

NCT04340479,2020-07-30,Recruiting,,Observational [Patient Registry],The Use of Ultrasound in Establishing COVID-19 Infection as Part of a Trauma Evaluation,The Use of Ultrasound in Establishing COVID-19 Infection as Part of a Trauma Evaluation,COVID|Trauma|Ultrasound,Ultrasound lung imaging as part of FAST+ evaluation,All,,,Accepts Healthy Volunteers,80045,,,,Cohort,,"       The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created a unique situation for       initial healthcare providers who strive to provide optimal medical care while minimizing       personal exposure in acute scenarios. Although the morbidity and mortality for this disease       is low for young healthy individuals, it presents a potentially serious threat to older       healthcare providers or those providers with chronic medical conditions. Once a patient       arrives emergently to the emergency department (ED) setting, ED providers must act promptly       to evaluate these individuals for COVID-19 infection risk factors such as exposure, symptoms,       and chronic medical conditions. However, some medical and surgical patients presenting       emergently for evaluation are unable to provide a reliable medical history due to age, drugs,       the absence of a next of kin, or altered mental status. Acutely traumatized patients often       undergo computed tomography of the chest during their comprehensive evaluation. Adding a       rapid bedside ultrasound of the chest as a research procedure could allow validation of       ultrasound to help stratify medical and surgical patients into high and low risk of COVID-19       categories, with no radiation exposure, and far faster than current COVID-19 diagnostic PCR       testing.       Aims: The project proposes to collect data that will inform a novel strategy to mitigate risk       to providers by providing early, objective, and rapidly collected end organ data which will       permit the stratification of pediatric trauma patients into low or high risk COVID-19       categories. The project will collect and evaluate lung ultrasound (US) findings in an       expanded Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) evaluation of the chest of       pediatric trauma patients. The term FAST+ is used to denote the use of FAST expanded to       image the select lung fields in traumatized patients. The researchers hypothesize that FAST+       will result in identification of pulmonary findings indicative of COVID-19 infections and       will significantly correlate with the gold standard derived from computed tomography (CT)       performed in parallel in these traumatically injured patients.     ","       The current COVID-19 pandemic is providing healthcare organizations with considerable       challenges and opportunities for rapid cycle improvement efforts, in diagnostic and patient       management arenas. Healthcare providers are tasked with limiting the use of personal       protective equipment while minimizing unnecessary exposures to the virus. Results from       real-time PCR tests to detect active COVID-19 infections may not be available in a timely       fashion during emergent trauma assessments. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a       rapidly expanding body of literature has identified a pattern of imaged lung abnormalities       with CT and ultrasound (US) characteristic of an active viral infection. US evaluation       provides a reliable, portable, and reproducible way of evaluating acute patients in a real       time setting. During initial trauma evaluations, patients may also receive adjunct imaging       modalities like the Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) exam designed to       discover life threatening findings that may require urgent interventions. We therefore       propose a study expanding on the current FAST adjunct evaluation in the trauma bay that may       include lung parenchyma imaging at the initial assessment to help stratify patients into low       or high-risk groups for active COVID-19 infections. We believe the use of point of care US in       the initial assessment of the trauma patient may help identify potentially infected       individuals and aid ED providers to best directing subsequent laboratory and imaging       evaluations for these patients, while further directing the necessary protective measures for       additional team members involved in the care of the injured patient.

Are people''s lifestyle decisions and choices to socially       distance or isolate affected by how information about their health status is communicated?       Does the presence of testing change the lifestyle decisions people make? We study and attempt       to answer these questions through a cross-sectional, online survey.       Two pilot studies will be run prior to the launching the main survey. The preliminary results       from these two surveys will be analyzed through EFA (exploratory factor analysis) and power       analysis in order to determine subscales, effect size, and appropriate sample size for the       main study. Additionally, a focus group consisting of approximately 15 college-educated       individuals will be asked to take the main survey in order to evaluate a reasonable time of       completion for the survey. The lower bound of this study completion duration will then be       utilized to establish reasonable survey completion time and thus create an exclusion       criterion based on time to survey completion.       Study participants will be first invited to complete a 9 question, pre-test survey on       Amazon''s Mechanical Turk. Respondents who pass the 4 attention check questions within the       pre-test will then be invited to complete the main survey.       An estimated 1400 participants will be recruited using Amazon''s Mechanical Turk to complete       the main survey. Of those, we anticipate 1194 participants to meet all inclusion criteria who       will then be included in the main study analysis. Participants will be included in the main       survey analysis if they read and agree to the English language consent form, are U.S.       residents (based on zip code data), correctly answer the attention check questions in both       the pre-test and main survey, and complete the main survey within a reasonable amount of time       (deemed to be 120 seconds or more).       Participants will be first invited to complete a 9 question, pre-test survey on Amazon''s       Mechanical Turk. Respondents who pass the 4 attention check questions within the pre-test       will then be invited to complete the main survey. After consenting to participate,       participants will be randomized to take one of three surveys each describing a different       scenario: one where they likely have COVID-19 but testing is not available, one where they       likely have COVID-19 and testing results show a positive result, and one where they likely       have COVID-19 and testing results show a negative result. Then, participants will be asked       questions about their activity and behavior intentions (e.g., stay in a specific room in my       home and stay away from all other people and pets, visit a friend or family member in       person). Participants will also be asked construct questions based off of Theory of Planned       Behavior/Reason Action Approach (located in the pre-test survey), along with a set of       demographic questions.       Survey responses will be summarized for the full sample, as well as stratified by testing       scenario. Quantitative responses will be summarized using means, standard deviations and       quartiles, and categorical and ordinal responses will be summarized using frequency       distributions. Comparisons between scenarios will be performed using one-way analysis of       variance (ANOVA) for quantitative variables, Kruskal-Wallis tests for ordinal variables, and       chi-squared or Fisher''s exact tests as appropriate for categorical variables.       The primary outcome is a difference in the behavioral sum score constructed using 11 items,       composed of two subscales. Secondary outcomes include the ''personal decisions'' and ''social       expectations'' subscales respectively. The ''personal decisions'' subscale will consist of the       items pertaining to masking, self-isolation, visiting friends, purchasing supplies,       undertaking physical activity, eating at a restaurant and having dinner at home with friends.       The ''social expectations'' subscale will consist of the items pertaining to getting a haircut,       attending weddings, funerals, and birthday parties. Other secondary outcomes including       likelihood of voting, protesting/political gathering, and public transportation 1-item       questions will also be analyzed in a similar fashion across the three different arms.       The primary hypothesis is that there will be a statistically significant difference in       willingness to engage in risky behavior based on COVID test results. This will be evaluated       using a linear regression model of the total 11-item score. The primary model term will be       scenario, and covariates will include age, sex, race/ethnicity, political affiliation,       education level, location, and type of residence. We will perform pairwise comparisons of the       3 scenarios, and use an 0.017 significance level (3-fold Bonferroni correction for an overall       alpha of 0.05). Secondary analyses will evaluate the subscales separately using a similar       approach. We will also perform exploratory analyses evaluating individual item responses       using ordinal logistic regression models with similar specifications. A 5% significance level       will be used for all secondary and exploratory hypothesis tests. All analyses will be       performed using R v. 3.6.2 (http://www.r-project.org).     ",       The purpose of this research is to conduct a cross-sectional survey to investigate how       people's lifestyle decisions and social distancing choices are affected by the medical       information they receive. The hypothesis is that a positive COVID-19 test result will lead to       study participants having the greatest self-isolation intentions compared to those who are       only clinically diagnosed for COVID-19 without a confirmatory diagnostic test result or those       who receive a negative COVID-19 test result.     ,Sum score constructed of 11 behavior items from 2 subscales (Personal Decisions and Social Expectations),Behavioral Intentions,"UCLA Health Department of Medicine, Quality Office; Los Angeles; California; 90095",""

It was reported in December       2019 in China, and was declared as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The number of cases quickly       increased in the USA since March; as of May 5th the total number of cases was 1''171,510 with       68,279 deaths.       COVID-19 is mainly spread through respiratory droplets of infected persons. While most       respiratory viruses are more infectious when a patient is symptomatic, viral, epidemiology       and modeling evidence suggest that also pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals are able       to transmit the infection. This information has implications on how resources can be spent on       public interventions to prevent spreading of the virus. It also can help guide further       management of pregnant women before, at, and after delivery.       Despite a recent publication reporting near 20% rate of positive COVID-19 tests in all       pregnant women with a 13% rate of asymptomatic patients admitted to Labor and Delivery, the       Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)       still recommend not prioritizing testing of patients who are asymptomatic. Meanwhile, the       American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists published a recent Practice Advisory that       encouraged prioritization of symptomatic patients but also acknowledges the potential impact       of asymptomatic patients.       Racial disparities have been reported among non-pregnant adults infected with COVID-19. Lower       income communities in New York City have a higher rate of infection, with Black and Hispanic       communities found to be twice more likely to die from the infection as compared to       Caucasians. Hispanic individuals are 1.7 more likely to get infected compared to their       non-Hispanic peers. As many individuals in these communities are essential workers such as       city employees and service personnel, many are undocumented; this is why public health       interventions such as home isolation, social distancing, and early testing might not be       applicable to these populations.       Inova Fairfax Hospital along with other hospitals from the Inova Health System (IHS) is       located in the Washington District of Columbia (DC)-Northern Virginia-Maryland area in the       east coast of the USA. Our hospitals provide obstetric care including anterpartum management,       surgeries and delivery to a vast number of patients with private insurance as well as those       uninsured from charity clinics in Northern Virginia. To minimize the risk of inadvertent       exposure of non-infected pregnant women and health care personnel to COVID-19 positive       asymptomatic patients, on April 25, 2020 IHS hospitals started testing for COVID-19 all       pregnant women admitted to Labor and Delivery and Antepartum units. In our institution, the       authors aim to investigate:         -  Rate of COVID-19 positive pregnant women         -  Prevalence of COVID-19 positive symptomatic and asymptomatic pregnant women admitted to            obstetric services         -  Demographic profile of COVID-19 positive asymptomatic pregnant women         -  Clinical outcomes of COVID-19 positive symptomatic and asymptomatic women         -  Rate of COVID-19 positive newborns from infected mothers         -  Rate and profile of COVID-19 infected pregnant women who require respiratory support in            comparison to those affected by other respiratory infections       Study design and participants This is an observational chart review study. Clinical records       and compiled data of all hospitalized and outpatient pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed       COVID-19 from March 18, 2020 to March 17, 2021 from IHS hospitals will be included in a       database. COVID-19 is diagnosed on the basis of the CDC definition.[12] A confirmed case of       COVID-19 is defined as a positive result on real-time       reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal-pharyngeal swab       specimens.[13] Data on recent exposure history, presence or absence of clinical symptoms or       signs, laboratory findings, and maternal and perinatal outcomes will be collected. All       medical records will be sent to the principal investigator at Inova Fairfax Hospital. Data       will be entered into a computerized de-identified database and cross-checked.       Outcomes and Abstracted Data The main outcome of the study is the rate of asymptomatic       pregnant women who test positive for COVID-19 at the time of hospital admission.       Secondary outcomes will be:         -  Rate of Hispanic pregnant women among those asymptomatic COVID-19 positive on admission         -  Rate of asymptomatic positive pregnant women who later will develop COVID-19 related            symptoms         -  Prevalence of COVID-19 positive newborns from infected mothers         -  Rate of COVID-19 positive pregnant women who develop respiratory / multi-organ            complications requiring admission to Medicine or Intensive Care units         -  Rate of maternal death related to COVID-19 infection       Data to be obtained during chart abstraction will be:       Maternal:         -  Demographics: Ethnicity, Age.

Data will be shown as means ± standard deviation (SD), or as medians (range), or as       numbers (percentage).     ","       In December 2019, Coronavirus infection (COVID-19) was identified as causing serious       respiratory infection in humans. Initially COVID-19 was propagated by infected symptomatic       individuals; currently the disease is disseminated by asymptomatic COVID-19 positive       subjects. The prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 individuals is unknown.       Due its physiologic immune suppression, pregnancy is a vulnerable time for severe respiratory       infections including COVID-19.       Limited information is available regarding the impact of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the       prevalence and demographic profile of asymptomatic pregnant women.       Despite reports of 15-20% positive COVID-19 tests in women admitted to Labor and Delivery,       professional obstetric medical societies still recommend not prioritizing testing of patients       who are asymptomatic.       In the USA, COVID-19 symptomatic patients come predominantly from lower income, Black and       Latino communities. No data are available on the rate and demographic distribution of       asymptomatic positive COVID-19 pregnant women.       To minimize the risk of inadvertent exposure asymptomatic individuals, recently our       institution started COVID-19 testing in all admitted pregnant women. The investigators expect       to gain knowledge on the impact of COVID-19 in pregnant women especially if asymptomatic and       compare to other respiratory infections.

OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.       The first 12 patients will all receive ibrutinib. In the randomized part, patients are       randomized to 1 of 2 arms.       ARM A: Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7. Treatment repeats       every 7 days for 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.       Patients who remain hospitalized or are re-admitted after 2 cycles may receive an additional       2 cycles per physician''s discretion.       ARM B: Patients receive usual care. Patients who meet the requirement of mechanical       ventilation may cross-over to Arm A.       After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 12 months.     ","       This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of ibrutinib and how well it       works in treating patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Ibrutinib may help       improve COVID-19 symptoms by lessening the inflammatory response in the lungs, while       preserving overall immune function. This may reduce the need to be on a ventilator to help       with breathing.

The COVID-19 global pandemic, along with mandated social and       physical distancing, is expected to have substantial repercussions on public mental health       and exacerbate the mental health crisis among teens. Adolescents, a group with significant       unmet mental health needs, are at risk during this time, as they are especially vulnerable to       depression and suicidality following environmental stressors, trauma, and social isolation       that are endemic to this global pandemic. With difficulties in receiving in person care       magnified during social distancing, now more than ever, there is an immediate need for safe,       accessible, and effective digital treatments for mental health disorders.       The proposed intervention is intended to increase access to mental health care during the       COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of a       cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)- based digital treatment for adolescent depression (Limbix       Spark) relative to psychoeducation. Limbix Spark implements behavioral activation (BA), a key       CBT skill that provides a sense of pleasure or mastery through self-monitored activities to       reduce depressive symptoms and improve functional outcomes.       Adolescents with depression (13-21 years old) across the country will be recruited to       participate in a fully remote, clinical trial via https://www.limbix.com/spark. At an initial       virtual visit, following informed consent, adolescents and parents (for those under 18) will       fill out standardized questionnaires designed to measure symptoms of depression, anxiety, and       general health. Participants will then download an app onto their mobile phone and be       randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group will receive the Limbix Spark program and       the other will receive the Psychoeducation program for 5 weeks. The Limbix Spark program is       divided into 5 levels. Each level provides educational information about cognitive behavioral       therapy and behavioral activation, and interactive activities including mood tracking and       activity scheduling. The Psychoeducation program is divided into 5 lessons. Each lesson       covers a different topic about depression. During both 5 week programs, patients will also       complete a weekly Patient Health Questionnaire, which is designed to measure depressive       symptoms and also will report any negative side effects they may be experiencing. After 5       weeks, participants and legal guardians (for those under 18) will complete another set of       standardized questionnaires designed to measure symptoms of depression, anxiety, and general       health. Patients will also complete questionnaires asking them about their thoughts and       experiences with the program they just completed. Lastly, a subset of patients and parents       will be invited to complete a virtual interview to provide feedback on using the program.     ","       Over 3 million teenagers in the USA have depression, and rates of depression and suicide are       sharply increasing. Teenage depression has far-reaching consequences including impairments in       academic and work performance and social and family relationships, substance abuse, and       worsening of other health conditions, which can persist into adulthood. Access to mental       health care for teenagers is limited due to a shortage of mental health providers and many       teenagers and parents are reluctant to take antidepressants. COVID-19 and mandated physical       and social distancing is expected to increase rates of teenage depression, and further limit       access to traditional methods of care (e.g. psychotherapy). This highlights an urgent need to       develop accessible, digital treatments for teenage depression to address the serious mental       health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This fully virtual study       (https://www.limbix.com/spark) will compare the relative safety, effectiveness, and       engagement of a mobile application based on cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral       activation (Limbix Spark), focusing on the idea that engaging in behaviors that are rewarding       or provide a sense of mastery can be effective in reducing symptoms of depression. Limbix       Spark will be compared to a mobile app containing educational material about depression       (Psychoeducation).

NCT04441996,2020-07-17,Enrolling by invitation,Phase 4,Interventional,Therapeutic Plasma Exchange for COVID-19-associated Hyperviscosity,Therapeutic Plasma Exchange for COVID-19-associated Hyperviscosity,COVID-19,Standard of care;Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE),All,18,,No,30308|30322,Treatment,Randomized,Parallel Assignment,,None (Open Label),"       Critically ill COVID-19 patients have high rates of complications, including respiratory       failure, renal impairment, and a coagulopathic state that may exacerbate these conditions and       contribute to additional end organ injury. Consistent with a fundamentally distinct nature of       COVID-19-associated disease, our preliminary studies demonstrate that patients with COVID-19       exhibit an increase in plasma viscosity. Furthermore, the researchers have found that plasma       viscosity strongly correlates with sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores, a       mortality prediction score used in the intensive care unit (ICU), in COVID-19 infected       patients. These results strongly suggest that altered blood flow secondary to hyperviscosity       may contribute to end organ injury and therefore morbidity and mortality in the most       critically ill COVID-19 patients. More detailed analysis of the potential etiology of       COVID-19-associated plasma hyperviscosity has demonstrated that these patients also have       significantly elevated levels of the plasma protein fibrinogen. Increased fibrinogen levels,       which may be either entirely responsible for or at least contribute to hyperviscosity in       these patients, may be the primary mediator of refractory hypercoagulability in this patient       population. Thus, hyperviscosity induced by hyperfibrinogenemia may be a critical driver of       morbidity and mortality in patients with COVID-19.       Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is the only procedure known to directly and rapidly       decrease plasma viscosity, suggesting that TPE may improve patient outcomes in critically ill       patients with COVID-19 by decreasing plasma viscosity and thereby enhancing blood flow.       However, as a procedure, extensive implementation of TPE would require significant devotion       of hospital resources, including apheresis machines and the staff needed to successfully       conduct these procedures. The procedures alone require staff to have prolonged interactions       with critically ill COVID-19 patients, placing them at a potentially increased risk for       contracting COVID-19. It is therefore essential that clear and unequivocal data be generated       in order to accurately assess the risk and benefits of this procedure for both patients and       staff. Such data will also aid in determining the necessary resources that may be needed to       successfully conduct TPE for this patient population.       Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive TPE or SOC. Participants in the TPE       study arm will receive two treatments of TPE with frozen plasma on sequential days. Plasma       viscosity will be measured before TPE (Day 1) and following the second TPE treatment (Day 3       or 4). Participants in the SOC study arm will also have their plasma viscosity assessed on       Days 1 and 3. Participants will be followed for the duration of their hospital stay.     ","       Many patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have atypical blood clots. These blood       clots can occur in either veins or arteries and be large, like in stroke or heart attack, or       very tiny, called microthrombi. Some patients with COVID-19 even have blood clots despite       being on anti-clotting medications. Blood with increased viscosity does not flow through the       body normally, in the same way that syrup, a highly viscous liquid, and water, a minimally       viscous liquid, flow differently. The researchers believe that hyperviscosity may contribute       to blood clots and organ damage seen in patients with severe COVID-19. Plasma exchange       removes a patient''s plasma, which contains the large sticky factors that the researchers       believe are increasing viscosity, and replaces it with plasma from healthy donors. In       addition to providing important information about plasma exchange as a treatment in COVID-19       for patients, this study will provide data to justify resource and staffing decisions.       This study will enroll 20 participants who are critically ill from COVID-19. Participants       will be randomized to receive therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) or standard of care (SOC).

Participants in both group A and group B will receive COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Group A       will include hospitalized COVID-19 patients ages ≥18 years with respiratory symptoms,       requiring >6 L of oxygen to maintain O2 saturation >92%. Patient may not require intubation,       and may be admitted for no longer than 14 days. Group B will include hospitalized COVID-19       patients ages ≥18 years requiring intubation. Patients may be enrolled in group A within 14       days of admission to the hospital and may be enrolled in group B at any time after       intubation. A total of 300 eligible subjects with significant oxygen requirements and 200       eligible subjects who require intubation will be included in the study. They will receive       convalescent plasma from either a patient who has recovered from COVID-19 or from an       asymptomatic carrier with confirmed IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Subjects will not be randomized.       The amount of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA in any unit of plasma will not be known when the       unit is assigned to the patient. This will allow us to examine the relationship between the       amount of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody and outcomes. Analysis will be based on measurement of       optical density of the IgG level in the unit of plasma the patient is randomly supplied by       the blood bank. While investigators and patients will be aware the patient is receiving a       unit of COVID-19 convalescent plasma, both the investigators and the patients will be blinded       to the antibody content of that unit.

Participants at the eight Michigan hospitals comprising the Beaumont Health system may be       eligible to participate. Study oversight and coordination will occur centrally, from the       Infectious Disease Research Department at Beaumont''s Royal Oak campus.     ","       The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 convalescent       plasma for the treatment of COVID-19. Plasma is the liquid part of blood that is left when       all the blood cells have been removed. Convalescent means it is taken from people who were       infected with COVID-19 and recovered. The use of this blood product to treat COVID-19 is       investigational, which means the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved it to       be sold commercially. This is a human blood product collected by licensed blood banks. Donors       of COVID-19 convalescent plasma must meet all standard blood donor criteria and must also       meet all criteria set by the FDA for being a donor of COVID-19 convalescent plasma.       A total of 500 patients will take part in the study at 8 hospitals within Beaumont. Similar       studies are being done at other centers, but they are not directly related to this study.       Participants will be assigned to a study group depending on how sick they are.         -  Group A: Those who require more than 6 liters (L) of supplemental oxygen but are not on            a ventilator         -  Group B: Those who require a ventilator to preserve their life.       Both groups will receive one unit (approximately 200ml or just under 1 cup) of COVID       convalescent plasma. The transfusion will be given over about 30 minutes via an IV. Blood       samples will be taken prior to and one hour after the transfusion to measure participant       antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and a nasopharyngeal swab (deep in the nostril) will be taken       to test for presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Phase 1 will be a       single convalescent timing immune retrospective study; phase 2 will include paired samples to       increase immune response accuracy in a prospective study. In phase 1, hospitalized PUI and       APS patients with negative nasopharyngeal PCR swabs selected by Epic query of Bassett       records, will be contacted by telephone (or in person if hospitalized), offered enrollment in       the study, and provided informed consent if they''re interested. For consented/enrolled       patients, routine baseline demographic and clinical data will be obtained by interview (in       person or telephone) and/or EMR (Epic) review. These data will be needed to describe baseline       characteristics and to assess for predictors of serologic conversion and other immune       responses in the two study populations. Up to two to three visits will be required for brief       interviews, record review, and blood draws. Phase 1 patients will have visits/blood draws on       days 14 and 28 after hospitalization or at 28 days after hospitalization only (-3 days, +60       days) if patients are beyond day 14 at the time of study initiation; phase 2 patients will       have visits/blood draws aiming for days 0, 14 (+/- 3 days), and 28 (+/- 3 days) after       hospital admission.       Blood will be drawn for SARS-CoV-2 specific immune assays (below). For phase 1 patients,       baseline immune assays will not be available as blood is not available for them; thus, for       many phase 1 patients, only one of the day 14 and 28 immune assays will be practical. In       Phase 2, these procedures will be the same except baseline blood draws will be possible at       hospitalization as well. Thus, blood drawing will be at target days 0, 14, and 28 for phase 2       patients. Short interviews at days 14 and 28 will be conducted to assess for new COVID-19       compatible illnesses that may confound immune response results.       Up to 27.5 ml of blood will be required at each timepoint (PAXgene tube 2.5 ml, heparinized       tube 10 ml, EDTA tube 10 ml, SST tube 5 ml). Total blood drawing will be up to 55 ml in phase       1 patients and up to 82.5 ml in phase 2 patients. Serologic and additional immune assays will       be conducted on blood drawn at these time points to assess for SARS-CoV-2 specific immune       responses (see below).

Many regular users of Botox Cosmetic will have exceeded their normal treatment interval and       their glabellar wrinkles will likely have returned to baseline. Many will want to get treated       as soon as stay at home orders are rescinded and clinics are permitted to open back up. It       would not be surprising that these patients also are experiencing a decrease in their mood       secondary to weeks of social isolating and distancing. Many can expect to have a rebound       elevation in their happiness and overall mood following the modified return to normalcy.       Botox Cosmetic has been studied as a mood elevating drug by reducing the animation of a       glabellar furrow via the facial feedback mechanism hypothesis. This has been shown in       patients who are not diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. Following a natural       disaster, does the administration of Botox Cosmetic, in patients who are frequent Botox       Cosmetic users, synergistically amplify the elevation in mood beyond what would be achieved       had they not had their Botox Cosmetic treatment.

NCT04424446,2020-07-13,Recruiting,,Observational,Saliva as Source of Detection for SARS-CoV-2,Evaluation of Saliva as Source of Detection for SARS-CoV-2,COVID-19,,All,18,,Accepts Healthy Volunteers,20010|20892,,,,Case-Only,,"       Because of the inconvenience of nasopharyngeal (NP) testing for SARS-CoV-2 detection, we are       interested in identifying different strategies for detecting infection. A technique that is       less intrusive would put individuals undergoing testing at lower risk for complications,       would likely increase compliance with subsequent tests, and would decrease risk to the       providers who are conducting the test. For asymptomatic screening, some institutions are       using midturbinate swabs instead of NP swabs, for increased compliance due to decreased       discomfort. The NIH has switched to midturbinate collection in asymptomatic collections only.       A test that would require only expectorating saliva and/or collection of a midturbinate swab       would address the issues of NP collection discomfort. Saliva is the most preferred by       patients or asymptomatic staff due to no collection in the nasal cavity at all. Although the       CDC lists midturbinate swab as an acceptable specimen type, there are minimal data about the       sensitivity of this collection for SARS-CoV-2, and decisions to use midturbinate swabs are       based in part on experience with other respiratory viruses. Also, if saliva were found to be       equivalent to NP for patient testing, there will be a benefit to future patients in providing       this option for testing. Therefore, we propose to validate these sample types for SARS-CoV-2       detection. The RT-PCR results based on a saliva sample alone or a saliva sample coupled with       a midturbinate swab, will be correlated with the results using surveillance or diagnostic       swab samples to validate their use for SARS-CoV-2 detection.     ","       Background:       Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabbing is being used to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection. For this, a swab       is inserted deep into the back of the nose to collect a sample. It can cause discomfort for       most people. Researchers want to find an easier way to collect samples.       Objective:       To learn if testing for SARSCoV-2 with a saliva sample only, a nasal swab from just the front       part of the nostril only, or a saliva sample plus a nasal swab gives results that are as       accurate as the NP swab.       Eligibility:       NIH staff members age 18 and older who are taking part in NIH CC SARS-CoV-2 surveillance.       Design:       The Occupational Medical Service (OMS) collects NP swabs as part of standard NIH staff       screening. Participants will give 1 or 2 saliva samples and 1 or 2 nasal swabs when their NP       swab is collected by OMS. If their NP swab was already collected, their OMS record will be       reviewed for the result.       If the NP swab result is positive, the participant will have another NP swab. At that time,       they will also give 1 or 2 saliva samples and 1 or 2 nasal swabs. If the NP swab result is       negative, they will give 1 or 2 saliva samples and 1 or 2 nasal swabs the next time they have       an NP swab.       For the saliva sample, participants will spit into a tube.       For the nasal swab, the inside of the front part of the nostril will be swabbed.       Participation ends after the study samples are collected. Participants can choose to keep       giving saliva and nasal swab samples each time they have an NP swab.

Specifically, in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ARDS, proning intubated patients       improves overall mortality. With the emergence of SARS-COV-2, hospitals around the world have       seen a marked increase in patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS. This       surge in cases has prompted a search for more effective strategies to reduce intubation and       improve patient morbidity and mortality. One such strategy is that of voluntary proning, in       which awake patients are instructed to prone themselves (Early PP With High Flow Nasal       Cannula (HFNC) Versus HFNC in COVID-19 Induced Moderate to Severe ARDS) (COVID-19       smArtphone-based Trial of Non-ICU Admission Prone Positioning (CATNAP)).       This trial proposes a voluntary proning strategy in patients admitted to the hospital, not       yet requiring mechanical ventilation. Given the clear evidence that proning improves outcomes       in ARDS, investigators hypothesize that early, voluntary self-proning may prevent intubation       and improve mortality in patients with SARS-COV-2.       Methods       This is a pilot study of up to 100 participants at UCHealth facilities.       Patients will be assessed if they can self prone safely and be assessed against inclusion and       exclusion criteria within 12 hours of admission and randomized to either prone or supine       positioning. Baseline labs will be measured and all participants will be monitored       continuously via pulse oximetry.       The Standard Supine Control Group will utilize standard oxygen (O2) device in supine position       at approximately 30-60 degrees to target peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) >90%       and the participant or nurse will document time in non-supine position.       The Prone Experimental Group will position patient in approximately 15-degree reverse       trendelenburg and prone using pillows for comfort. The participant will be asked to rotate to       prone positioning every 2 hours while awake and encourage to sleep prone overnight as       possible with a goal of 10-12 hours daily. Patient to log all time prone.       Treatment Failure may occur and termination of Intermittent Prone Positioning will occur.       This is defined as respiratory distress or a decrease in O2 saturations <90% for more than 2       minutes as determined by bedside nursing or per virtual pulse oximetry monitoring       notifications during the study on two consecutive occasions. The participant will be returned       to supine positioning and follow standard supine oxygenation. The participant can be       re-challenged in the prone position after the participant stabilizes for 2 hours. The       participant can also choose to stop proning and would be considered a treatment failures.       Statistical Analysis and Sample Size In New York City the intubation rate has been reported       at 1/3 of COVID-19 positive patients admitted to the hospital. The table below shows the       sample size needed for a binomial outcome of intubation when 50% of the sample is randomized       to Prone Positioning (PP):       Alpha 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 Beta 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80 Probability of intubation with PP 0.05       0.10 0.15 0.20 Probability of intubation 0.33 0.33 0.33 0.33 Proportion receiving PP 0.50       0.50 0.50 0.50 Sample size 33 39 56 97       Expecting a 13% decrease in intubations with the prone position, investigators will use a       sample size of N = 100 (50 per group) in order to have 80% power with a two-sided alpha =       0.05 for logistic regression. ANCOVA will be used to evaluate continuous, secondary variables       in order to adjust for covariates. The study is powered for the primary outcome of intubation       or no intubation.

Samples collected in       locations including public testing sites, workplaces, nursing homes, and residential housing       are transported to centralized laboratories for testing, leading to lengthy delays in results       reporting. The window of maximal contagiousness is thought to be only a few days, so these       delays create the risk of excess transmission. Current testing methods are painful, which       encourages testing hesitancy. Rapid, onsite detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from non-invasive       saliva could overcome these issues and provide a pathway to high-throughput detection of       people at the greatest risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission but the logistics of such a testing       program require real-world prototyping.       The investigators have developed a simple test to detect high concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in       saliva with assays that require no specialized equipment and can be completed in one hour.       This assay is not diagnostic for SARS-CoV-2; instead, it specifically identifies saliva       samples that have high amounts of viral RNA that are correlated with live virus shedding.       Many samples that would be identified as SARS-CoV-2 by diagnostic qRT-PCR would be negative       with this saliva assay. Conversely, positive detection of RNA in saliva is a finding of       potential clinical relevance, so participants whose samples are positive will be contacted by       a medical professional to discuss potential follow-up with their own health care provider,       including a possible independent diagnostic testing.       Because the assay requires no specialized equipment, it can be performed at the site of       sample collection using a portable laboratory that fits in the backseat of a car. The       prototype testing will take place in a variety of settings that may include parking lots,       workplaces, nursing homes and residential housing. Participants will be asked to consent to       provide a saliva sample that will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels consistent with live       virus shedding. The consent document will explicitly state that this is not a diagnostic test       for SARS-CoV-2 but that a positive finding could be of clinical significance that should be       discussed with a medical professional. Participants can opt-out of receiving any results at       the time of consent and can provide samples for the sole purpose of contributing to community       surveillance and assay development. Consent forms will be reviewed and signed and held by       team members in a secure location (locked box at the collection site) until taken back to the       AIDS Vaccine Research Laboratory for storage. Participants will then spit into a coded vessel       (e.g., cup or tube). Samples should be at least 1ml (~¼ teaspoon) and will be assayed for the       presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the aforementioned detection assay; the presence of high       concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is indicated by a colorimetric change from pink to       yellow/orange.     ",       The purpose of this research study is to evaluate and improve a rapid COVID-19 test. The test       is designed to identify people who are most contagious and likely to spread the virus to       others. This test will be performed at various locations in the Madison area (including       workplaces and schools) using a mobile laboratory. Saliva samples will be collected and       processed at these locations with results of positive tests being communicated to the       participants by a healthcare worker on the study team. Individuals with a positive test       result will be encouraged to self isolate and discuss obtaining a diagnostic test at their       earliest convenience.     ,"Feasibility is determined when at least 1000 samples are tested and consistently shown that the assay can detect SARS-CoV-2 safely, consistently and accurately at multiple locations using the mobile laboratory. This testing protocol will be considered safe if COVID-19 rates of those performing the tests do not significantly exceed those of the communities in which the tests are being performed.",Safety: COVID-19 rates of Investigators vs Communities tested,University of Wisconsin; Madison; Wisconsin; 53711,""

The aim is to correlate results       of reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using various sample types,       assays, and culture. We will perform serial screenings of NIH employees who have had contact       with reported, suspected, or known cases. We will also enroll individuals with previous or       current infection who are asymptomatic at enrollment. The serial screenings will be done at       multiple timepoints over 2 days using (RT-PCR) tests of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, saliva       samples, midturbinate swabs, antibody assays, and culture.       Objectives:       Primary Objective:       Correlate results of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR using various sample types, antibody assays, and       culture.       Secondary Objectives:         1. Determine rate of culture positivity in individuals who persistently shed virus.         2. Determine proportion of individuals who develop asymptomatic infections.

Facilities Enrolling Participants: NIH CC.       Study Duration: 3 years.       Participant Duration: 28 days (with 35 additional extension visits every 2 to 4 weeks until       the participant has 2 consecutive negative RT-PCR results).     ","       Background:       People who have had contact with a person with a known SARS-CoV-2 infection are being told to       self-quarantine for 14 days. This is done to avoid potential virus spread. But the actual       time it takes for a person to develop an infection after being exposed to the virus is not       well known. The proper quarantine time could be less or more than 2 weeks. Researchers hope       this study can be used to help improve public health guidelines for quarantines, social       distancing, and returning to work after a possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure.       Objective:       To better understand how long it takes a person to develop (or not develop) an infection with       the SARS-CoV-2 virus after they have had contact with a person who has a confirmed infection.       Eligibility:       NIH staff members age 18 and older who had recent contact with a person who has a SARS-CoV-2       infection       Design:       Participants will have 3 study visits at the NIH Clinical Center. They may be asked to have       an extra visit depending on the test results at the third visit.       At each visit, participants will give a blood and saliva sample. It will be used to test for       SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Their temperature will be taken. They will complete a short survey to       collect data about possible COVID-19 symptoms. At the first visit only, they will also       complete a survey that asks about their recent social contacts.       Two types of nasal samples will be collected at each visit. These samples will be tested for       the SARS-CoV-2 virus.         1. a swab will be inserted deep into the back of the nose &         2. a swab will be inserted to the middle of your nose.

The first confirmed cases occurred in December in Wuhan, Hubei province,       China. It now infects people on six continents, spreading person to person. The World Health       Organization (WHO) classified it as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. As of April 6, 2020,       there are more than 1.2 million confirmed cases and more than 70,000 deaths attributed to       this virus. Every person on Earth, as well as every United States Veteran, is at risk. This       is the emergent public health threat of our time.       SARS-CoV-2 is a singled stranded RNA virus related to severe acute respiratory       syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1). SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be transmissible largely       by respiratory droplets or direct contact, but might also be transmitted through       aerosolization. SARS-CoV-2 disease severity ranges from no to minimal symptoms, mildly       symptomatic with cough and dyspnea, to severe respiratory distress with multi-organ failure       requiring admission to an intensive care unit and emergent ventilator support. Although data       are evolving, the severity of illness varies with age, co-existing comorbidities, and       biological sex, with older age, people with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, and males       manifesting greater disease severity.       A worldwide effort is in place to contain and suppress human-to-human transmission. These       public-health strategies aim to slow the rate of spread and reduce the burden on critical       care infrastructure. However, there is also a need effective therapeutics. Vaccine trials are       underway but potential approvals are at least a year away. Development of new drugs de novo       to treat SARS2-CoV-2 will likely take even longer. Thus, the most expedient therapeutic       strategy to confront this pandemic will repurpose existing FDA-approved therapeutics. One       potential strategy targets viral components directly, using existing antivirals and       anti-infectives currently used for other diseases. Such efforts include trials of       hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and ribavirin. Another strategy involves targeting the human       proteins, rather than viral proteins, required for SARS CoV-2 entry and replication.

According to the official website of the WHO1, more       than 3 million people have been confirmed to have a COVID-19 infection, and over than 200,000       deaths have resulted from COVID-19 in almost every area or territories around the world1. To       effectively cope with the COVID-19 outbreak, various governments have implemented rapid and       comprehensive public health emergency interventions that include social restrictions and       quarantines, which is the separation and restriction of movement of people who might have       been exposed to the virus. Non-essential workers were required to stay at home and the       shutdown of non-essential businesses are among the restrictions that influence the lives of       millions across the globe. While the physical risk (e.g. pneumonia, respiratory breakdown) is       getting the most scientific and clinical attention, this outbreak also has significant mental       health risks and extreme psychological fear-related responses.       The outbreak of COVID-19 caused public panic and mental health stress. The rapidly changing       information on COVID-19 and the increasing number of confirmed cases and death have elicited       fear and anxiety about becoming infected. Isolated at home, people consume information that       might be unreliable and unverified for many hours every day. The widespread use of social       media and the extensive array (or sources) of information can increase confusion and worries       which in turn increases fear and anxiety. Moreover, indirect exposure to 24-hours of       television news and social media has a wide range of psychopathological consequences, of       which Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSD) symptoms are the most common.2 A recent study3       conducted in China one month into the outbreak examined the prevalence of mental health       problems in COVID-19 era and found a high rate of depression (48.3%), anxiety (22.6%) and a       combination of depression and anxiety (19.4%) among 4,872 people. Furthermore, people with       increased social media exposure were almost twice as likely to have depression and anxiety       than people with less social media exposure. To date, more than 3 billion people are being       asked to stay at home, which may lead to increased exposure to social media, likely resulting       in widespread mental health problems among isolated individuals around the globe. Given the       magnitude of the COVID-19 outbreak, its risk to physical and mental health,and the unique       nature requiring to stay isolated, sheltered, at hospitals, or at home, an effective and       timely response is essential to address the psychosocial needs associated with the ongoing       exposure to social media, disease, death, and distress.       Among the general population, there are high-risk groups as elderly people, disabled       individuals and people with previous exposure to trauma (e.g., people with military       experience). Veterans are among the subgroups who are high risk for PTSD and other mental       health problem. Furthermore, many veterans are reluctant to seek help, despite enduring       symptoms, they avoid mental health care, or may wait years to decades before they seek help.4       Among reasons to avoid seeking help, patients report mistrust in mental health providers,       being seen as weak or stereotyped as dangerous/violent/crazy, and a belief that they are       responsible for having mental health problems.5,6Applying strategies to reduce self-stigma       and improve help seeking behavior among veterans may ameliorate impaired functioning and       reduce risks for long-term psychiatric illness. Thornicroft7 showed that social contact is       the most effective type of intervention to improve helpseeking behavior and stigma-related       attitudes. Social contact involves interpersonal contact with a member of the group; While       both direct, in-person social contact and indirect, video-based social contact have       effectively improved attitudes toward mental illness, the latter can be implemented on a       larger scale.8-10 Corrigan and colleagues11 identified the most important ingredients of       contact-based programs: an empowered presenter with lived experience who attains his/her       goals (e.g., I was able to fight the COVID-19).

Women who identify       concerning moles will choose among three options: a) watch the mole to see if the border,       color or diameter of the mole changes b) send a picture of the mole to the PI for       consideration of mole self-sampling, or c) make an appointment with my healthcare provider to       check the mole. As required a physician will supervise women, who will perform non-invasive       mole self-sampling with non-invasive adhesive patches for genomic analysis of the concerning       pigmented lesion (mole).

","       The purpose of this study is to reduce melanoma mortality by improving early detection of       melanoma with skin self-examination (SSE) among people who self-identify as being at risk and       seek care for a concerning mole. Because women are more likely than men to perform SSE, women       who are engaged in health promotion by having a recent screening mammogram are the focus of       this research. Self-management of melanoma detection with SSE depends on ready access to       dermatologists when a concerning mole is detected. In March 2020, the Illinois stay at home       order (COVID-19) prohibited non-essential health care, including screening mammography and       dermatology office-based care, and both are expected to remain limited until fall 2020.

NCT04493307,2020-06-30,Recruiting,,Observational,The Evaluation of Hemostasis in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients,"The Evaluation of Hemostasis by Thromboelastography, Platelet Function Testing, and Biomarker Analysis in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients",COVID-19,Phlebotomy,All,3,,No,21215,,,,Other,,"       The investigators hypothesize that serial evaluation of (a) intrinsic thrombogenicity       measured by thromboelastography (b) platelet activation and aggregation, and (c) selected       biomarkers will provide the blueprint of individual hemostasis to precisely characterize       COVID-19 patients who are at heightened risk for thrombosis or bleeding. The latter will       facilitate future efforts to personalize antithrombotic therapy regimens in COVID-19       patients.       Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral respiratory illness caused by the severe acute       respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been shown to predispose patients to       thrombotic diseases (venous and arterial) with reported rates in hospitalized patients       between 17- 40%. The influence of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the coagulation is hypothesized to       be regulated by platelet activation, proinflammatory cytokines, endothelial cell injury and       stasis.       The elevated levels of d-dimer and fibrinogen and clinical signs of organ damage point to a       significant hypercoagulable state. The latter induces a high risk for micro-thrombi and       multiorgan ischemia. Therefore, early detection and a comprehensive understanding of the       influence of the virus on the coagulation and platelet pathways are essential to address this       epidemic. It is critical at this time to make all efforts possible to optimize our available       technology to care for COVID-19 patients who are at risk for thrombotic disease through       appropriate choice, dosing, and laboratory monitoring of antithrombotic therapy.       Our research group and others have reported a thrombo-inflammatory state-a distinct       pathophysiological state -of heightened platelet function, hypercoagulability, and       inflammation in several cardiovascular disease (CVD) processes. It has been demonstrated that       patients with acute respiratory infections are at elevated risk for acute myocardial       infarction after influenza (incidence ratio [IR] 6.1, 95% CI 3.9-9.5) and after non-influenza       viral illnesses including other coronavirus species (IR 2.8, 95% CI 1.2-6.2). Tantry et al.       proposed a mechanistic link between inflammation and heightened thrombogenicity in the       presence of unstable CVD state. Furthermore, investigators have hypothesized that this       thrombo-inflammatory state becomes even more relevant when patients with CVD and human       immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).A       similar scenario may be present during COVID-19 infection, where evidence of an early       myonecrosis may be related to fundamental changes in pathways affecting thrombosis. However,       currently, there is no information on how COVID-19 influences hemostasis/thrombosis pathways       and subsequent adverse clinical event occurrences.       Cardiovascular comorbidities including hypertension, obesity, high cholesterol, and diabetes       mellitus are common in patients with COVID-19 and such patients are at higher risk for       morbidity and mortality.12 Furthermore, emerging demographic data in COVID-19 patients shows       that incidence and mortality is disproportionately higher in African Americans and Latinos.       In a study conducted at Sinai hospital, Lev et al. analyzed a large cohort of racially       diverse patients (n=1,172) with CAD or CV risk and demonstrated that sex and race are       significantly associated with platelet-fibrin clot strength, a marker of hypercoagulability.       Most interesting, AA women had the highest thrombogenicity profile, potentially conferring a       highrisk phenotype for thrombotic event occurrence. Furthermore, in a study entitled,       PlateletReactivity in Different Ethnicities also conducted at Sinai hospital, investigators       have demonstrated that Latino and AA races had the highest platelet-fibrin clot strength as       compared to Caucasians and others races studied.The latter findings may be described by       difference in frequency of a single-nucleotide variant in protease-activated receptor-4       (PAR-4) between AA and Caucasians respectively (63% vs 19%). PAR-4 is an active thrombin       receptor on human platelets essential for thrombin-induced platelet activation and has been       shown to be more active in African Americans as compared to Caucasians. This evidence may       provide a potential mechanistic explanation for racial disparities observed in COVID-19       patients and require further investigation. Hence, investigators will collect a genetic       sample to analyze single-nucleotide variant of PAR-4 and other genetic markers related to       thrombosis.       Thromboelastography (TEG) is a method for measuring global hemostasis and has been widely       used in surgery and anesthesiology, emergency departments, trauma centers, intensive care       units,and cardiac catheterization labs for transfusion management, prediction of thrombotic       and bleeding events, and choice/adjustment of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapies.       Light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) is a widely used gold standard method for identifying       heightened platelet reactivity to various agonists, a marker of thrombotic risk.More common       conventional coagulation tests include prothrombin time (PT, INR), partial thromboplastin       time (aPTT), fibrinogen, platelet count, and d-dimer. However, these latter tests do not       reflect interactions between platelets, endothelium, and fibrinolytic factors and must be       used in combination to provide a complete picture of hemostasis status. Unlike these tests,       the TEG can assess platelet function, clot strength, and fibrinolysis. Furthermore, The TEG6s       Hemostasis Analyzer is a portable, all-in-one cartridge-based system that requires minimal       blood sample and minimal sample processing, a potential safety advantage when processing       blood samples in COVID-19 patients. Lastly, COVID-19 infection may be associated with acute       cardiac injury as indicated by elevation of cardiac biomarkers to > 99th percentile of the       upper reference limit, but also electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities.       Cardiac injury is highly prevalent in patients with COVID-19 but may not be an important       marker as it occurs after damage has been done. Inosine and hypoxanthine are specific markers       of acute cardiac ischemia (ACI) that are measurable within 20 minutes as compared to 4 hours       with CKMB and Troponin testing. Investigators believe that this marker may indicate the early       presence of micro-thrombi and organ damage. Investigators plan to investigate these novel       markers in this trial. Investigators hypothesize that COVID-19 is a heightened       prothrombotic/hypercoagulability state that can be characterized using platelet function       testing and Thromboelastography. More information is required to study the effect of COVID-19       on coagulation and platelet pathways to develop effective antithrombotic treatment       strategies.       The study is a multi-center, non-interventional study involving laboratory testing of blood       samples and data collection for a COVID registry using electronic medical records. The study       specific laboratory assessments will be obtained at baseline (closest to time of       hospitalization), Day 3 and Day 8 from baseline, and at hospital discharge. Patients will be       followed for clinical events during hospitalization, and 1 and 6 months after discharge.       Patients (n=100) hospitalized at Sinai Hospital of Baltimore and Northwest Hospital with at       least one of the following will be enrolled.         1. With a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection using a positive RT-PCR or a positive            IgG antibody test prior to or during hospitalization or,         2. With a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test but with symptoms of possible COVID-19infection            and:              1. an elevated D-dimer and/or              2. positive imaging results showing unilateral or bilateral pneumonia or ground glass                 opacity in lungs.     ","       Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral respiratory illness caused by the severe acute       respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been shown to predispose patients to       thrombotic diseases (venous and arterial) with reported rates in hospitalized patients       between 17-40%. The influence of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the coagulation is hypothesized to       be regulated by platelet activation, proinflammatory cytokines, endothelial cell injury and       stasis. The elevated levels of d-dimer and fibrinogen and clinical signs of organ damage       point to a significant hypercoagulable state. The latter induces a high risk for       micro-thrombi and multi-organ ischemia. Therefore, early detection and a comprehensive       understanding of the influence of the virus on the coagulation and platelet pathways are       essential to address this epidemic. It is critical at this time to make all efforts possible       to optimize our available technology to care for COVID-19 patients who are at risk for       thrombotic disease through appropriate choice, dosing, and laboratory monitoring of       antithrombotic therapy.       The investigators hypothesize that COVID-19 is a heightened prothrombotic/hypercoagulability       state that can be characterized using platelet function testing and thrombelastography. More       information is required to study the effect of COVID-19 on coagulation and platelet pathways       to develop effective antithrombotic treatment strategies.       This is a multi-center center, non-interventional study enrolling patients who are COVID-19       positive or who have tested negative showing indication of the disease (high D-dimer and       positive lung imaging). The study specific laboratory assessments will be obtained at       baseline (closest to time of hospitalization), Day 3, and Day 8 from baseline and at hospital       discharge. Laboratory measurements for TEG 6S , platelet aggregation, T-TAS, urinary       thromboxane, genotyping, serum and plasma biomarkers will be analyzed . In-hospital and       clinical follow-up data will be entered into a COVID registry Patients will be followed for       clinical events during hospitalization, and up to 6 months after discharge.       Patients (n=100) hospitalized with at least one of the following will be enrolled.         1.

The study hypothesizes prevalence will be       higher than seen in other studies.       An additional aim is to identify predisposing or mitigating exposures for PICS-F. The study       hypothesizes that increased psychological symptoms will be associated less exposure to       virtual patient visits (tablet/video conferencing), higher number of patient comorbidities       (using the Charleston comorbidity index), preexisting family member psychological conditions.

","       Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel infectious disease caused by severe acute       respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This syndrome has been associated with high       mortality, estimated to be about 1.7% of all infected in the US, though in those who develop       acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the context of the infection, mortality rates       appear to be much higher, perhaps up to 70%. To avoid transmission of the virus, patient       isolation has become the standard of care, with many hospitals eliminating visitors of any       type, and particularly eliminating visitation to patients infected with COVID-19. These       necessary, but restrictive, measures add stress to the ICU and particularly to the family       members who are not only left with fear, but also many unanswered questions. In contrast to       the Society of Critical Care Guidelines (SCCM) which recommend family engagement in the ICU       and recent data from this study team which suggests engaging families in end-of-life       situations reduces symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in family members,       family members are now unable to say good-bye and unable to provide support to their       loved-one throughout the process of the patients'' ICU stay. The study hypothesizes is that       these restrictive visiting regulations will increase rates of Post-intensive care syndrome-       family (PICS-F) which includes symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety and aim to evaluate       for factors that either exacerbate these symptoms or protect from them.

CT-V       and PBM images provide surrogates for pulmonary ventilation and perfusion, respectively, in       the form of detailed functional maps. CT-V and PBM therefore allow us to distinguish healthy       from abnormal lung. Moreover, the technique generalizes to recover lung compliance imaging       (LCI) when the CT is acquired at different pressure settings, in order to characterize lung       stiffness. PBM and CT-V can detect parenchymal lung function changes at a voxel level and can       be used to 1) assess disease progression in SARS-CoV-2, 2) detect treatment effects, and 3)       identify early changes in high-risk patients prior to their development of disease. BQLFI       affords the opportunity to provide imaging biomarkers that enable the early diagnosis of lung       injury, which in turn cause impairment in gas exchange at the level of alveolar capillary       interface. Currently, there are no available imaging biomarkers to predict patients at risk       of progression or identify those at risk of developing severe disease with SARS-CoV-2. Our       proposed study will validate a novel methodology, based on state-of-the-art CT-V and PBM       imaging that can accurately measure regional ventilation and perfusion, as a means for       improving surveillance, diagnosis, and prognostication of patients with SARS-CoV-2. This is a       prospective, pilot study of 25 adult patients with SARS-CoV-2, who have mild to moderate       disease, defined as positive PCR screen and not requiring invasive mechanical ventilator       support or noninvasive ventilation or high flow nasal cannula. Participants will provide       informed consent and eligibility will be confirmed. Demographics and medical history will be       obtained. Participants will undergo one inspiration-expiration CT. Outcomes and adverse       events will be assessed over 30 day using chart review or phone interview.     ","       The goal of this study is to evaluate if CT (Computerized Tomography) can effectively and       accurately predict disease progression in patients with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory       syndrome coronavirus 2). You may be eligible if you have been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, are       an inpatient at Beaumont Hospital-Royal Oak and meet eligibility criteria. After consent and       determination of eligibility, enrolled patients will have a CT scanning session. After the CT       scan, patients are followed for 30 days by reviewing their medical records and by phone after       discharge from hospital.     ","Disease progression will be characterized as requiring mechanical ventilator support, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, high flow nasal cannula or mortality within 30 days.CT-V and PBM scores will be calculated at a voxel level from inhalation-exhalation CT scan. Several CT-V pulmonary function metrics, including the volume of identified cold spots (areas with decreased ventilation and perfusion), total ventilation and perfusion and radiographic fibrosis score will be calculated to assess regional ventilation/perfusion and compared to disease progression. The number of participants with correlation between these factors will be reported.","Predictive association between CT-V, PBM score and disease progression","Beaumont Health; Royal Oak; Michigan; 48073; Joanne Gondert, RN, BSN; joanne.gondert@beaumont.org; 248-898-0343","Joanne Gondert, RN, BSN; 248-898-0343; joanne.gondert@beaumont.org"
NCT04418518,2020-06-24,Recruiting,Phase 3,Interventional,A Trial of CONvalescent Plasma for Hospitalized Adults With Acute COVID-19 Respiratory Illness,CONCOR-1: A Randomized Open-Label Trial of CONvalescent Plasma for Hospitalized Adults With Acute COVID-19 Respiratory Illness,COVID-19,Convalescent plasma,All,18,70,No,10021|10038|11201,Treatment,Randomized,Parallel Assignment,,None (Open Label),"       Problem to be addressed: In December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee (Wuhan,       China) identified an outbreak of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause. Coronavirus RNA was       quickly identified in some of these patients.This novel coronavirus has been designated       SARS-CoV-2, and the disease caused by this virus has been designated COVID-19.Outbreak       forecasting and mathematical modelling suggest that these numbers will continue to rise [1]       in many countries over the coming weeks to months.Global efforts to evaluate novel antivirals       and therapeutic strategies to treat COVID-19 have intensified. There is an urgent public       health need for rapid development of novel interventions. At present, there is no specific       antiviral therapy for coronavirus infections.       Passive immunization: Passive antibody therapy involves the administration of antibodies to a       given agent to a susceptible individual for the purpose of preventing or treating an       infectious disease due to that agent. In contrast, active vaccination requires the induction       of an immune response that takes time to develop and varies depending on the vaccine       recipient. Some immunocompromised patients fail to achieve an adequate immune response. Thus,       passive antibody administration is the only means of providing immediate immunity to       susceptible persons and immunity of any measurable kind for highly immunocompromised       patients. The only antibody type that is currently available for immediate use is that found       in human convalescent plasma.The American Food and Drug Agency (FDA) has recently announced       clinical trials and a facilitated access to COVID-19 convalescent plasma for use is patients       with severe or life-threatening infections [2].       Known potential risks and benefits: There is a theoretical risk of antibody-dependent       enhancement of infection (ADE) through which virus targeted by non-neutralizing antibodies       gain entry into macrophages. Another theoretical risk is that antibody administration to       those exposed to SARS-CoV-2 may avoid disease but modify the immune response such that those       individuals mount attenuated immune responses, which would leave them vulnerable to       subsequent re-infection. Finally, there are risks associated with any transfusion of plasma       including transmission of blood transmitted viruses (e.g. HIV, HBV, HCV, etc.), allergic       transfusion reactions, including anaphylaxis, febrile non hemolytic transfusion reaction,       transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion associated cardiac overload       (TACO), and hemolysis should ABO incompatible plasma be administered. Potential benefits of       COVID-19 convalescent plasma include improved survival, improvement in symptoms, decreased       risk in intubation for mechanical ventilation, decrease risk of intensive care unit (ICU)       admission, shortened hospitalization time and suppression of viral load.       Mechanism of action: Transfusion of apheresis frozen plasma (AFP) from COVID-19 convalescent       patients allows the transfer of donor neutralizing antibodies directed against SARS-CoV2       antigens to the recipient, thus allowing the generation of passive immunization. Naturally       produced human antibody are polyclonal, meaning they are directed against a variety of       different viral antigens and epitopes allowing for a general neutralizing effect against the       virus rather than focussing on a specific target. Administration of convalescent plasma has       been associated with rapid decrease in viral load. It is also possible that passive       immunization contributes to improved cell-mediated immunity by favoring the phagocytosis and       presentation of viral antigens to host T cells.       Participant recruitment:Only hospitalized COVID-19 patients are eligible so recruitment       efforts will be focused on identified consecutive patients admitted to hospital with acute       COVID-19 infection. No other external recruitment efforts are planned. At each participating       hospital, a process for identifying patients with COVID-19 will be established.       Donor recruitment: Recovered COVID-19 patients will be identified as potential donors in       collaboration with public health services, local health authorities, and individual       co-investigators involved in the study. Potential donors may also be recruiting following       self-identification on the routine donor questionnaire or through social media. They will be       contacted by phone and invited to participate in the program as potential donors. After       obtaining verbal consent and reviewing donor selection criteria, eligible participants will       be directed to a New York Blood Center site in their area to donate.       Criteria for donors: All donors between the ages of 18 and 70 will need to meet donor       selection criteria set forth by the FDA and NYBC. In addition, donors will require:       Prior diagnosis of COVID-19 documented by a PCR test at time of infection or by positive       anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology following infection At least 14 days since resolution of COVID-19       symptoms Male donors, or female donors with no pregnancy history or with negative anti-HLA       antibodies At least 6 days since last plasma donation Provided informed consent       Randomization procedures: Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (convalescent plasma vs       standard of care). Patients will be randomized using a secure, concealed, computer-generated,       web-accessed randomization sequence. Randomization will be stratified by centre and age (<60       and ≥ 60 years). Within each stratum, variable permuted block sized will be used. This       approach will ensure that concealment of the treatment sequence is maintained.       Duration of follow-up: Subjects will be followed daily until hospital discharge or death.       Patients discharged from hospital before Day 30 will be contacted by telephone on Day 30 ± 3       days to ascertain any AEs, vital status (dead/alive), hospital readmission and need for       mechanical ventilation after discharge. Patients discharged from hospital will be contacted       at Day 90+/- 7 days to determine vital status. Patients with a prolonged hospital admission       will be censored at Day 90. The local study coordinator will collect all study data and       record the data in the electronic CRF or paper CRF as per study procedures for each site.       Duration of study: For an individual subject, the study ends 90 days after randomization. The       overall study will end when the last randomized subject has completed 90 day follow-up. We       estimate that all patient will be enrolled in a period of 6 months, data on the primary       endpoint will be available 30 days after last patient enrollment and data on all secondary       endpoints will be available after 90-day from last patient enrollment.       Sample size considerations: Assuming a baseline risk of intubation or death of 30% in       hospitalized patients with standard of care, a sample size of 1200 (800 in the convalescent       plasma arm, and 400 in the standard of care arm) would provide 80% power to detect a relative       risk reduction of 25% with convalescent plasma therapy using a 2-tailed test at level α =       0.05 and a 2:1 randomization.       Interim analysis: A single interim analysis is planned when the primary outcome (intubation       or mortality at 30 days) is available for 50% of the target sample. An O''Brien-Fleming       stopping rule will be used at that time, but treated as a guideline, so there is minimal       impact on the threshold for statistical significance for the final significance test of the       primary outcome. A DSMB will monitor ongoing results to ensure patient well-being and safety       as well as study integrity. The DSMB will be asked to recommend early termination or       modification only when there is clear and substantial evidence of a treatment difference.       Final analysis plan: The primary analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat population       which will include data from all individuals who have been randomized. Outcomes will be       attributed to the arm to which individuals were randomized irrespective of whether they       received the planned intervention (e.g. plasma from a convalescent COVID-19 donor).     ","       There is currently no treatment available for COVID-19, the acute respiratory illness caused       by the novel SAR-CoV-2. Convalescent plasma from patients who have recovered from COVID-19       that contains antibodies to the virus is a potential therapy. On March 25th, 2020, the FDA       approved the use of convalescent plasma under the emergency investigational new drug (eIND)       category. Randomized trials are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of COVID-19       convalescent plasma for acute COVID-19 infection.       The objective of the CONCOR-1 trial is to determine the efficacy of transfusion of COVID-19       convalescent plasma to adult patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection at       decreasing the frequency of in-hospital mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.       It is hypothesized that treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma       early in their clinical course will reduce the risk of death, and that other outcomes will be       improved including risk of intubation, and length of ICU and hospital stay.       WCM is a U.S. sub-site to this pan-Canadian clinical trial (NCT04348656) which has the       potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden on health care resources       including reducing the need for ICU beds and ventilators.

This time period allows for       calendar months in 2020 representing the key time period of the pandemic - after testing       became available and changes were implemented in healthcare. Inclusion of the same months       from 2019 represent the time period prior to the pandemic.       In addition to the cohort of women delivering at the selected MFMU Network sites on randomly       selected days, all pregnant and immediately postpartum (within 6 weeks of delivery) with       confirmed COVID-19 infection will be included in this study. Both women who were managed       in-patient and those managed out-patient with COVID-19 infection will be included. All       pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 infection between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020       will be followed for maternal and neonatal outcomes through 6 weeks after delivery or       surgical removal of the pregnancy.       Trained research staff will abstract data from the hospital''s electronic medical records that       meet eligibility criteria. Measures of healthcare and community-based modifications in       response to the pandemic will be recorded by research staff. Individual participant data will       include baseline data, COVID-19 exposure data, and maternal and neonatal outcome data.       The three primary objectives are 1) to evaluate whether pregnant or immediately postpartum       women experience higher maternal morbidity and mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic than       before the pandemic, 2) to evaluate whether women with COVID-19 infection, both in- and       out-patient, have higher maternal morbidity and mortality than pregnant women without       COVID-19 infection, and 3) to describe maternal and neonatal outcome data for all pregnant       and immediately postpartum women with a confirmed COVID infection and contribute these data       to an NICHD COVID-19 pregnancy registry. The primary endpoint, maternal morbidity and       mortality, is defined as morbidity related to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, morbidity       related to postpartum hemorrhage, or morbidity related to infection during pregnancy or       within six weeks (42 days) postpartum. For primary objective 1, the study has more than 90%       power to show a 30% increase in the rate of the primary endpoint assuming the rate is at       least 3% in calendar year 2019 and an alpha of 0.05 two-sided. For primary objective 2, the       study will have more than 85% power to detect a 50% increase in the primary composite       maternal morbidity endpoint, from 5% to 7.5% with an alpha=0.05 two sided if only 1,000       confirmed COVID-19 people are enrolled (80% power to detect a 30% increase in the primary       composite if 2,200 confirmed COVID-19 people are enrolled).       For objective 1, analyses of the primary endpoint will consist of summarizing the proportions       of participants with the primary endpoint for each calendar year cohort and calculating the       corresponding relative risks with 95% confidence intervals. Individual morbidity composites       (hypertensive disorders, postpartum hemorrhage, and infection) will also be compared by       calendar year cohort. Outcome rates within 2019 will be graphically displayed and tested over       time to ensure changes are not evident during the year that may explain differences between       calendar years 2019 and 2020. For objective 2, analyses of the primary endpoint will consist       of summarizing the proportions of participants with the primary endpoint among women with       confirmed COVID-19 infection and those without confirmed infection, and calculating the       corresponding relative risk with 95% confidence intervals.

Lung neutrophilia in       ARDS is related to significant neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) production and formation.       Thus, NET production is likely contributing to the severe lung pathology in SARS-CoV-2 (Yu       Zuo et al. JCI Insight. 2020). Recent connections have been made between NET formation in       SARS-CoV-2 patients and excessive thrombosis and the development of cytokine storm further       warranting evaluation as a potential site for consideration of treatment (Barnes, Betsy et       al. J exp Med. 2020). Dornase alfa (Pulmozyme) is a recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I,       that acts as a mucolytic by cleaving extracellular chromosomal DNA from NETs and other       cell-free DNA. Unknown are the effects of dornase alfa therapy on SARS-CoV-2 related ARDS and       if therapy with dornase alfa truly reduces the amount of NETs in the severely damaged lungs.       This study is a non-randomized, single-center, open-label clinical trial to evaluate the       potential benefit and cellular mechanism of nebulized dornase alfa administration in       mechanically ventilated patients with SARS-CoV-2 related ARDS. Evaluation of dornase alfa       effects at a cellular level will be measured by analysis of blood samples before and after       the 3 days of therapy for cell-free DNA, quantification of citrullinated histone H3,       quantification of MPO-DNA complexes and analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage samples for       quantification of NETs and cell count and differential.     ","       This study is designed to evaluate a potential mechanism by which a hyperactive immune       response may contribute to death from SARS-CoV-2; by an excessive neutrophil-mediated       deposition of cell-free DNA in neutrophil extracellular traps (NET). Excessive amounts of       NETs can increase rigidity of mucus, clog airways, and be agents for the development of acute       respiratory distress (Narasaraju et al., Am J Pathol. 2011). Many aspects of this pathway       have been observed in severe SARS-CoV-2 (Zhang et al., Respiratory research. 2020). Dornase       alfa (DNAse I; Pulmozyme (Genentech) is a nebulized drug that works by degrading cell-free       DNA and thus promoting airway clearance and recovery. The investigators hypothesize that by       thinning mucus and degrading these NETs further lung damage may be prevented and a reduction       in time to recovery may occur. The two aims of the study are to see if inhaled/nebulized       dornase alfa will improve clinical outcome measures in SARS-CoV-2 related acute respiratory       distress syndrome (ARDS) and to see if dornase alfa reduces the amount of bronchoalveolar       lavage and blood markers of NET activity.       The study will recruit patients who are on mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure       related to SARS-CoV-2 positive infection and have ARDS based upon Berlin criteria.

The world is currently experiencing COVID-19 pandemic with a       significant portion of those infected developing severe disease manifestations including       pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome with respiratory failure, and, in some cases,       death. The clinical characteristics and spectrum of disease severity of acute COVID-19 are       currently being defined. Since COVID-19 is a new disease, very little is known about possible       clinical sequelae that may persist after resolution of the acute infection. In addition, the       characteristics of the initial cellular immune and antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 (the virus       that causes COVID-19) have not been fully defined and it is not known if the immune responses       generated by infection provides long-term protective immunity. The purpose of this study is       to establish a longitudinal cohort that has recovered from COVID-19 and characterize the       clinical sequelae of acute infection, characterize the immune response to the virus, and       follow the evolution of the immune response over time and determine the extent to which       natural immunity is protective against re-infection.     ","       Background:       COVID-19 is a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It infects the respiratory tract. Some       people who get COVID-19 have only mild symptoms. But for others, infection leads to       pneumonia, respiratory failure, and, in some cases, death. Researchers want to learn more       about any effects that may persist after people recover from COVID-19.       Objective:       To learn about any long-term medical problems that people who have recovered from COVID-19       might have, and whether they develop an immune response to SARS-CoV-2 that provides       protection against reinfection.       Eligibility:       People age 18 and older who have recovered from documented COVID-19 or were in close contact       with someone who had COVID-19 but did not get the infection       Design:       Participants will be screened over 2 visits. During visit 1, they will answer questions about       any symptoms they are having and will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection which will involve a       nasal swab sample or other FDA approved test. If the test is negative, they will proceed to       the second visit, which will include:       Physical examination       Medical history       Mental health interview (which may be recorded if the participant agrees)       Chest x-ray (for recovered COVID-19 participants only)       Blood and urine tests       Pregnancy test (if needed)       Lung function test (for recovered COVID-19 participants only)       6-minute walk test (for recovered COVID-19 participants only)       Questionnaires about their general and mental health       Leukapheresis to collect white blood cells (optional).       Participants will be put into 1 of 2 groups: the COVID-19 group or the close contact group.       Participants will have study visits every 6 months for 3 years. They will repeat some of the       screening tests. Participants in the COVID-19 group may have visits more often if they       develop symptoms that suggest re-infection with SARS-CoV-2....

Patients with controlled blood glucose have a lower mortality rate than       those who are uncontrolled. However, a rigid blood glucose control - which may lead to       hypoglycemia- is associated with higher mortality rates. Thus, adequate glucose monitoring is       important for hospitalized diabetic patients.       Previous studies have shown that CGMS, in the outpatient setting, engender better glycemic       control thereby reducing risk of hypoglycemia. CGMS offer a replacement for finger stick       blood glucose monitoring which may not identify an incidence of hypoglycemia until symptoms       drive the patient to test. Furthermore, finger stick blood glucose monitoring is painful and       time consuming thus causing many patients to avoid this aspect of diabetes self-care       management.       Freestyle Libre CGMs sample interstitial fluid glucose subcutaneously. Measurement       frequencies typically range from 1 to 15 minutes and most commonly are every 5 minutes.       Previous studies in hospitalized patients living with diabetes mellitus on basal bolus       regimen have shown:       • Use of the CGM increased detection of both hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events versus       those sensed by POCT.       One investigation identified 88 postprandial hyperglycemic excursions in patients with CGM       use as opposed to 61 in those with POCT. Another noted that when comparing the CGM use with       that of POCT, the former identified 55 hypoglycemic events whereas the latter only found 12.       • No difference in mean daily glucose CGM and POCT readings. In a study of 38 patients, the       investigators noted no difference in mean daily glucose between the CGM and POCT.     ","       The FDA has provided an emergency waiver for the use of non-invasive continuous glucose       monitors (CGM) in hospitals, so frontline health care providers (in hospitals) can remotely       monitor patients with diabetes thus reducing patient''s discomfort, limiting exposure to       COVID-19 and preserving critical personal protective equipment (PPE). The FreeStyle Libre       14-day system is a continuous glucose monitoring system consisting of a handheld reader       (smart phone may be used) and a sensor applied with adhesive to back of the upper arm. In       order to evaluate the reliability of the Freestyle Libre CGM for in-patient use, we propose a       study which will examine the correlation between the libre CGM data and capillary blood       glucose test - the current standard of care taken by the Accuchek Inform II platform.

The study consists of five parts:         1. Screening / Baseline / Treatment (Day -1 to 1): lasts up to a maximum of 24 hours and            comprises a screening / baseline assessment. This visit will be used to confirm that the            study inclusion and exclusion criteria are met and serves as baseline assessment prior            to randomization. Baseline blood tests will be performed in all patients; those who            screen fail because of study inclusion / exclusion criteria (e.g., serum CRP, liver            function tests), will not undergo randomization. Eligible patients will receive a single            i.v. infusion of MAS825 or placebo on Day -1 to 1.         2. Treatment period (Day 2-15): Study assessments to be conducted every 2 days for            hospitalized patients. If patients are discharged from the hospital prior to Day 15,            assessments on the day of discharge should be performed according to the schedule listed            under Day 15 and patient should return to the site for the Day 15 assessment (all other            visits between discharge and Day 15 can be omitted). If hospital visit is not possible            at Day 15, then home nursing services may be used to support this last visit where these            are available in accordance with local guidelines and should include all possible            assessments (e.g. oxygen saturation with portable monitors). In case home nursing is not            possible, patients will be contacted by phone on day 15.         3. Follow-up (Day 16-29): After completion of the treatment period, patients will be            observed until Day 29 or discharged from hospital, whichever is sooner.

The       question bank for the questionnaire is attached to the application. It includes demographics,       education and employment, and questions about symptoms, contacts and exposures, the       participant''s household, behaviors, and practice of mitigation strategies. The opportunity to       enroll and complete the baseline questionnaire will remain open for 1 month. Follow up       surveys will be made available to consented participants on the same day for each week they       are administered. The investigators anticipate a 20% response rate to the survey (N~1500).       Recruitment materials, consent and questionnaires, materials related to return of results to       participants, and verbal study communications will be available in both English and Spanish.       COVID-19 PCR testing A randomly selected subset of individuals who consent to participate       (N~300-500 initially, with the potential to expand testing to more survey participants as       additional funding becomes available), weighted to ensure representation by race/ethnicity,       age, and sex, will be invited to participate in COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)       viral testing by at-home collection and return of self-administered nasal swabs. Saliva       specimens may replace the nasal swab specimen. Specimens will be collected at baseline and       every 2 weeks in conjunction with questionnaire administration. Participants will have the       opportunity to opt out of participation in this component at the time of consent and       enrollment. Those who do not opt out will be eligible for the random selection for COVID-19       testing. The investigators will provide specimen collection materials and instructions for       collection, along with return shipping instructions to participants in pre-prepared kits.       COVID-19 PCR testing will be conducted at the North Carolina State Laboratory of Public       Health. This is a CLIA-certified laboratory. Samples for COVID-19 PCR testing will be       identified only by a unique study identification number for each participant. Results of       COVID-19 testing will be returned from the State Lab to the MURDOCK Study investigative team       as results are available from testing (expected turnaround time ~4 days from receipt at State       Lab) by secure transfer for incorporation into the RedCap study database.       COVID-19 serology testing The same randomly selected subset of individuals who collect       at-home samples for COVID-19 PCR testing (N~300-500 initially, with the potential expand to       more survey participants as additional resources become available), will also provide a blood       sample for serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Specimens will be collected by       routine venipuncture at the MURDOCK Study office in Kannapolis, NC and potentially 2-3       additional locations in Cabarrus County. Study visits for venipuncture will be deferred for 2       weeks in participants whose nasal swab PCR testing for COVID-19 is positive. Participants       will be screened for COVID-19 symptoms at the time of scheduling the visit for venipuncture       and at arrival for the visit. Participants who screen positive for COVID-19 symptoms will be       referred for clinical COVID-19 testing and will have their initial serology testing deferred       until a negative clinical test is documented or for 2 weeks if clinical testing is not       performed.       Specimens for serology will be collected at baseline approximately 1 month after the first       questionnaire and 2 weeks after the first nasal swab collection and COVID-19 PCR testing.       Specimens for serology will be collected at least bi-monthly and up to monthly thereafter       through a total study duration of 6, and up to 12, months. SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing for       IgG antibodies will be conducted in the laboratory of Thomas Denny, MSc, MPhil in the Duke       Human Vaccine Institute on the campus of Duke University Medical Center using a commercial       IgG assay (Perkin-Elmer). Samples for serology will be identified only by a unique study       identification number for each participant. Results of serological testing will be returned       from the Denny laboratory to the MURDOCK Study investigative team at regular, prespecified       intervals by secure transfer for incorporation into the RedCap study database. The Denny       laboratory is CLIA-certified. Any residual serum after SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing will be       frozen at -80°C and stored for future use in the Duke COVID-19 Biorepository (Pro00105316).       Return of Results to Participants:       The investigators will share aggregate results from questionnaires and testing with all       participants and the public through multiple routes, including email, social media and the       press and with the scientific community through presentations at scientific meetings and       publications. The investigators will also provide regular reports on accruing study data to       NCDHHS. Participants will not be identified individually in these aggregate reports. The       investigators also will return the results of both COVID-19 PCR testing and serologic testing       for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to individual study participants. Individual return of results will       follow the following principles:       COVID-19 test results. A standard template for return of negative COVID-19 test results will       be IRB approved and used to notify participants of their results. If a participant tests       positive for COVID-19, the participant will be contacted by phone by the study PI or a       designate to convey the result. General recommendations for participants who test positive       will be IRB approved. The investigators will also offer these participants a link through       which they can consider participation in the Duke COVID Community Watch support program       (Pro00105189). Positive COVID-19 test results will also be reported to the local/state health       department.       SARS-CoV-2 serology results. An IRB approved standard template will be used to convey the       results of SARS-CoV-2 serology to participants. Care will be taken to ensure that       participants understand what information the results of their SARS-CoV-2 serology conveys       (and does not convey) in order to avoid any risk of misinterpretation, particularly of       positive results.

The MURDOCK NCDHHS       COVID-19 Prevalence Study will examine COVID-19 prevalence and SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence       in Cabarrus County, NC by leveraging the community-based cohort enrolled in the MURDOCK Study       Community Registry and Biorepository (MURDOCK Study). The MURDOCK Study is an ongoing       longitudinal health study operated by the Translational Population Health Research Center in       the Duke Clinical & Translational Science Institute and approved by the Duke University       Institutional Review Board (Duke IRB Pro00011196). The MURDOCK Study recruited 12,526       residents from 20 Zip Codes in the Cabarrus County/Kannapolis region, and currently follows       10,407 active participants. As part of the MURDOCK Study, all participants provided       demographic, clinical, and behavioral data via an enrollment questionnaire, were geospatially       mapped at the street address level, and consented to a yearly follow up questionnaire. They       also provided consent to be contacted by MURDOCK Study staff up to four times per year to       consider participation in future research opportunities. A recent protocol communication to       the IRB was approved to allow additional contacts for high priority COVID-19 research studies       (Pro00011196-SE-45.0). Our study population for this protocol will include approximately 7200       active MURDOCK Study participants who currently reside in North Carolina and have a valid       email address on file. The active study participants who receive a recruitment email and       consent to participate (estimated 20%) will have the opportunity to declare their interest in       testing and from among those 300-500 will be randomly selected to participate in the testing.       The anticipated number to enroll is set at 1,000 but may be adjusted up based on response       rate.

In order to fight       this pandemic, emergency measures have been implemented in different countries such as       lockdown, social distancing and testing. It is known that these measures have differed among       countries and due to the lack of tests worldwide, the real number of affected and/or       immunized people remains largely unknown. In this context, the daily most important surrogate       markers have been the numbers of infected hospitalized and deceased population. However,       asymptomatic infections are not uncommon (representing up to 30% of infected cases) and the       detection of this population seems crucial to prevent their potential transmission and to       guide the development of measures to control the ongoing pandemic.       This is a descriptive, prevalence study that aims to define the current contagious risk and       immune status to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection in two reproduction health centers in the USA       located in Utah and Massachusetts. Aiming for the better technical procedures available,       different biological samples (nasopharyngeal swab, saliva, and blood sample) from each       participant will be tested applying two different methodologies already approved by Health       Authorities, and nowadays the most commonly used for the COVID-19 diagnose: Reverse       Transcriptase - Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for the analysis of the nasopharyngeal       swabs and saliva samples and Immunoassay by serology for the blood serum analysis.       A total of 400 participants, distributed equally between the two participant centers, are       expected to be included in 2 months.The total expected duration of the study is 4 months for       collecting, processing and analysing samples from participants (patients and clinical staff),       although the participation in the study will entail just a single visit (coinciding with the       same day of the samples collection). After that visit, no further interventions or follow-up       directly related to this study will be required.       Data exported from the clinical histories and source documents will be duly codified to       protect the clinical and personal information of patients in accordance with the current       legislation. This information will be exported to an electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) for       its analysis. Given the exceptional situation that the world is facing with the COVID-19       pandemic, U.S. authorities demand the report of all tested cases, so patient´s data will be       communicated to the U.S. national health authorities when the result of the test is positive.     ","       In late December 2019, a new coronavirus strain emerged causing coronavirus disease 2019       (COVID19). Since then, COVID19 has become a global pandemic outbreak being declared a public       health emergency of international concern by the International Health Regulations Emergency       Committee of the WHO on January 30, 2020. Several emergency measures have been implemented in       different countries such as lockdown, social distancing, and testing.       The pandemic concerns to public worldwide but also to couples aiming to conceive through       natural means or undergoing assisted reproductive technologies (ART). The American Society of       Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) as well as European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology       (ESHRE) have recommend a precautionary approach and advise that all fertility patients       considering or planning treatment, even if they do not meet the diagnostic criteria for       COVID-19 infection, should avoid becoming pregnant at this time until more is known about the       virus. Therefore, new cycles for infertility patients as well as non-medically urgent gamete       preservation treatments, such as social egg freezing, have been suspended deferring embryo       transfer in those patients with initiated cycles. In this moment, when reopening phases are       being undertaken in most countries, the decision to resume the In vitro fertilization (IVF)       treatment in a safe environment to the healthcare workers and patients is the biggest concern       of the ART clinics.       The present study aims to describe the percentage of COVID-19 condition (naïve, immune, and       currently infected) in asymptomatic individuals from two different ART centres. For this       purpose, the ART centres'' personnel and patients will be tested for COVID-19 before resume       the clinic daily routine just after the lockdown period.

Increases       in stress, social isolation, loss of daily routine, decreased physical activity, and excess       screen time that are likely to arise as a function of the pandemic and mitigation efforts are       risk factors for developing insomnia. Left unchecked, this acute insomnia can become chronic,       resulting in increased risk of negative mental health outcomes such as depression, anxiety,       and suicidality. The current proposal aims to test whether a telehealth intervention for       insomnia can be used to not only prevent the progression of acute to chronic insomnia, but       also prevent the worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms, suicidality, and quality of life in       those most vulnerable to negative mental health outcomes.       These aims will be achieved through a randomized 2-arm controlled trial design. 100 eligible       adults experiencing sleep disturbances and who also have a history of depression and are in       the at-risk group for COVID-19 will be randomized to receive either a sleep intervention       (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia, CBT-I; n=50) or a 7-month waitlist (n=50). CBT-I       improves sleep patterns through a combination of sleep restriction, stimulus control,       mindfulness training, cognitive therapy targeting dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and       sleep hygiene education. Neuropsychiatric symptoms, Quality of Life, suicidality, and sleep       disruption will be assessed at baseline (Week 0) and at the end of the sleep intervention (or       Week 7) through online surveys and clinical interviews. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (anxiety       and depression) and sleep disturbance (Insomnia Severity Index, and sleep diaries) will be       assayed at baseline and each week throughout treatment/waitlist to assess week-to-week       changes following an increasing number of CBT-I sessions.

Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been approved for treatment of many       hematologic and solid neoplasm. Imatinib is a weak base that compared to the extracellular       compartment is enriched over 1000-fold in the lysosome within several hours as a result of       its lysosomotropic property. Imatinib as a weak base accumulates in lysosomes resulting in       some antiviral activities by lysosomal alkalization required for virus/cell fusion.       Imatinib demonstrates in vitro activity against SARS-CoV viruses. Imatinib inhibit SARS-CoV       and MERS-CoV with micromolar EC50s (range, 9.8 to 17.6 μM) with low toxicity. The mechanism       of action studies suggested that ABL-1 tyrosine kinase regulates budding or release of       poxviruses and Ebola virus, demonstrating that the c-ABL-1 kinase signaling pathways play an       important role in the egress of these viruses. It is also reported that kinase signaling may       also be important for replication of two members of the Coronaviridae family, SARS-CoV and       MERS-CoV. In vivo studies performed in the mouse model of vaccinia virus infection showed       that imatinib was effective in blocking dissemination of the virus.       Imatinib has anti-inflammatory activity including its effectiveness in a two-hit murine       model of acute lung injury (ALI) caused by combined lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and       ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Imatinib significantly decreased bronchoalveolar       lavage protein, total cells, neutrophils, and TNFα levels in mice exposed to LPS plus VILI,       indicating that it attenuates ALI in this clinically relevant model. In another experiment,       imatinib attenuated ALI when given 4 hours after LPS, suggesting potential efficacy when       given after the onset of injury. Overall, these results strongly suggest the therapeutic       potential of imatinib against inflammatory vascular leak and a potential role of imatinib       combination therapy for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) on       mechanical ventilation.       The investigators hypothesize that addition of imatinib to the best conventional care (BCC)       improves the outcome of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19. This hypothesis is on the       bases of 1) intralysosomal entrapment of imatinib will increase endosomal pH and effectively       decrease SARS-CoV-2/cell fusion, 2) kinase inhibitory activity of imatinib will interfere       with budding/release or replication of SARS-CoV-2, and 3) because of the critical role of       mechanical ventilation in the care of patients with ARDS, imatinib will have a significant       clinical impact for patients with severe COVID-19 infection in Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

There is currently no vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2       or therapeutic agent to treat COVID-19. The objective of this protocol is the identification       of eligible donors and collection of anti-SARSCoV-2 immune plasma from convalescent survivors       of COVID-19 illness.       Potential subjects will be screened for eligibility to participate in plasma donations and       their blood measured for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Enrolled subjects will receive a baseline       physical and laboratory examination. Subjects with high SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody       titers who meet standard blood bank criteria for plasma donation will then be scheduled for       plasma collection sessions. Following testing of the collected plasma for potential       pathogens, this plasma may be used and/or converted into an intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)       preparation for further study.     ","       Background:       The human disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is called COVID-19. In most cases, COVID-19 is a mild       to moderate respiratory illness. But it can also be more severe and even lead to death. There       is no vaccine to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is also no therapy to treat COVID-19.       Researchers want to collect plasma from adults who have recovered from COVID-19, which may       help them develop treatments.       Objective:       To collect anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune plasma from adult volunteers who have recovered from       COVID-19.       Eligibility:       Males and females ages 18 to 70 who have a history of COVID-19 like illness or positive test       for SARS-CoV-2, and have a minimum level of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as specified by the study.       Design:       This study consists of 2 parts: 1) screening for SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer and eligibility to       donate plasma and 2) plasma collection by apheresis. Study sites may participate in 1 part       alone (either screening or plasma collection only) or both parts (screening and plasma       collection).       For screening part: Participants will be screened for their eligibility to join this research       study with a medical history and physical exam. Their vital signs (blood pressure, heart       rate, temperature, respiration rate) will be taken. Their weight and height will be recorded.       They will give a blood sample for clinical laboratory tests of their general health and a       research test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. They will discuss their history of COVID-19-like       illness and any testing for SARS-CoV-2. They will be evaluated for their ability to donate       plasma.       For plasma collection part: Subjects meeting criteria for plasma donation and found to have       high neutralizing antibody titers and who plan to donate plasma under this part of the study       will be scheduled for 1 (and up to 20) plasma collection sessions. These will occur no less       than 7 days apart.       Prior to each donation, participants will have a brief physical exam and complete a donor       history questionnaire. They will be asked about any current SARS-CoV-2 infection symptoms.       At each donation, plasma will be taken through a standard apheresis procedure. For this,       blood will be withdrawn through a needle placed in the participant''s arm vein. A machine will       separate the plasma from the red cells. The red cells will be returned to the participant,       either through the same needle or through a second needle in the other arm.       Participation may last up to 240 days.

This study will collect baseline samples and data prior to COVID-19 infection       required to explore these interactions prospectively. Early evidence in the COVID-19 pandemic       suggests that smokers have higher risk for morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19       infection. We have identified smoking-associated altered epigenetics, transcription and       changes in immune cell profiles. Smoking exposure drives loss of naive CD8+ T cells and       increases in senescent CD8+ T cells and these effects are signs of immune system dysfunction.       We propose that the immune system senescence associated with prior smoking is a       susceptibility factor in COVID-19 morbidity.       Objectives:       Primary Objective: To prospectively collect biospecimens and data at baseline and       longitudinally in an identified fashion from eligible participants and retain for future use       to better understand the interaction between smoking history, immune cell profiles and the       natural history of COVID-19 morbidity. We hypothesize that senescent CD8 T cells will be       higher in smokers who develop COVID-19.       To test this hypothesis, we will establish a bank of cryopreserved peripheral blood       mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from before and after COVID-19 exposure from smokers and nonsmokers       and use mass cytometry (CyTOF) to analyze detailed immune profiles, test if the frequency of       senescent CD8 T cells is higher among smokers who develop COVID-19 (antibody positivity)       relative to those who do not develop COVID-19 positivity.       Exploratory Objective: To compare potential immunological biomarkers of susceptibility to       viral infection with genetic, epigenetic and other biological characteristics measured in       blood before and after recovery from COVID-19 illness and develop assays that indicate immune       cell dysfunction and COVID-19 susceptibility.       Endpoints:       Primary Endpoint: Levels of senescent CD16+CD8+ T cells before COVID-19 and time to COVID-19       morbidity.       Exploratory Endpoints:         1.

Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants: All visits will be conducted at the       NIEHS Clinical Research Unit (CRU) in Durham, North Carolina, USA.       Study Duration: Estimated time from enrollment to completion of data analyses is 24 months.       Participant Duration: Estimated average amount of time for a participant to complete all       study visits is 6 months.     ","       Background:       Early evidence in the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that smokers are at a higher risk of having       severe effects or dying from the disease. Smoking causes changes in immune cells. Researchers       think this may be the reason why smokers are more likely to have severe effects from       COVID-19. Researchers want to better understand the interaction between smoking history, the       immune system, and COVID-19.       Objective:       To better understand how COVID-19 affects smokers and non-smokers immune systems before and       after being infected with the virus.       Eligibility:       Healthy people ages 30-55 who are a smokers or non-smokers who may potentially contract       COVID-19       Design:       Participants will be screened over the phone. They will answer questions about their       demographics, medical history, medications, and smoking status.       Participants will have up to 6 monthly visits.       At the first visit, participants will have blood tests. Blood will be drawn through a needle       in an arm vein. They will provide a saliva sample in a container. Their height and weight       will be taken. They will complete questionnaires about their medical history and smoking       status.       Participants will then have monthly visits. They will have blood draws to test for COVID-19       antibodies. These visits will occur 4 times or until they have a positive antibody result.       Participants will have a final visit. They will have blood tests.       If at any time participants test positive for a COVID-19, they will be rescheduled 14 days or       more after they no longer have symptoms....

The research hypothesis is that COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) transfusion improves       outcomes in patients with COVID-19.       The use of CCP to treat serious and life threatening COVID-19 has a sound biological as well       as clinical rationale to provide virus-specific immune protection in patients unable to       produce and/or maintain antiviral antibodies.

While the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19 has yet to be fully       understood, it is possible that a combination of high viral loads and an overactive       dysregulated inflammatory response may contribute. Therefore, the clearance of SARS-CoV-2       virus and cytokines could provide a more opportunistic environment for the innate immune       system to clear the virus and establish lasting immunity.

At the completion of the study, the       investigators will have further understanding of the effects of face masks during treadmill       based running. To the investigators knowledge this is the first study to assess the effects       of wearing protective cloth mask on exercise capacity.       Hypothesis The null hypothesis HO states that exercising with a cloth mask will be inferior       to the current standard of exercising without a facemask, limiting peak exercise when       non-inferiority margin is 1 estimated metabolic equivalent ( eMET 3.5 mlO2*kg-1*min-1).       The alternative hypothesis H1 states that exercising with a mask will not be inferior to the       current standard of exercising without a facemask, limiting peak exercise when       non-inferiority margin is 1 eMET.       EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN & METHODS Subject Recruitment: The investigators will recruit 20 subjects       though the Cleveland Clinic. Inclusion Criteria: Healthy subjects age > 18, Exclusion       Criteria: Any long-term disease that would interfere with their ability to exercise safely,       fever >100.4 F, or pregnancy. Informed consent will be obtained by the CoPI, and need for       medical clearance determined based on ACSM''s 2015 preparticipation guidelines. To remain       compliant with enterprise guidelines we will not be recruiting healthy subjects outside of       the Cleveland Clinic staff at this time to avoid increase COVID-19 exposure risk. However, if       the enterprise changes the guidelines we will expand our enrollment to include non Cleveland       Clinic employees. Employees will not be solicited by direct initiation. Recruitment will       involve only posted notice or general advertising that does not pressure employees into       participating for fear of job loss, delayed promotion, or other influences from their       superior.       Study Design: The study design is a prospective crossover non-inferiority trial where       subjects will complete 3 separate graded exercise treadmill tests each time wearing either No       Mask, N-95 Mask (3M), or Cloth Mask (Boco). The order of the mask worn will be randomly       assign to minimize familiarization or training effect. All testing will be performed in a       Cleveland Clinic facility following standardized COVID-19 screening precautions. The       investigators will compare the data collected from each test to asses for differences between       subject comfort, peak exercise capacity (eMET), heart rate response during exercise and       recovery.       Testing: After completing the informed consent and being medically cleared, subjects will       then perform a symptom limited graded exercise treadmill test using a modified Balke protocol       with continuous 12-lead EKG monitoring. Exercise tests will be stopped if any significant       cardiac arrhythmias occur or significant ST segment depressions develops. The test will be       terminated if ST elevation (> 1.0 mm), marked ST displacement (horizontal or downsloping of >       2mm, measured 60 to 80 ms after the J point), moderate to severe angina, Signs of poor       perfusion (cyanosis or pallor), Sustained ventricular tachycardia or other arrhythmia,       including second or third decree AV block, that interferes with normal maintenance of cardiac       output during exercise, or development of bunle-branch block that cnannot be distinguished       from bentricular tachycardia. The modified Balke, which is a well-accepted treadmill protocol       that keeps the speed constant and increases workload by grade. Subjects will rest for 3       minutes and resting heart rate, blood pressure, subjective perceptions of the face mask will       be measured. Subjects then will walk at 0% grade at 3 miles per hour for 2 minutes. Elevation       will be increased by 2% after the initial 2 minutes and by 1% each minute thereafter until       the test is terminated. Heart rate, RPEand oxygen saturation will be measured with a pulse       oximeter at baseline, last 5-10 seconds of each stage and the investigators will continue to       monitor heart rate during recovery at 1, 3 and 5 minutes post exercise. The investigators       will monitor each stage for perceived exertion, feelings of light headedness, anxiety, and       discomfort. The test will also be terminated at the request of the subject or if any chest       pain develops. The scale of measuring subjective perceptions instrument will be adminstereted       after collecting 5 minutes of resting, end of the exercise test, and at 5 minutes post       recovery. The graded exercise test will be performed once with No Mask, once with a 3M 8200       N-95 Respirator, and once with a Cloth Mask (Boco). Subjects will be randomized by a random       number generater (1= No Mask, 2= N-95, 3= Cloth Mask) to determine the order the perform each       exercise test No Mask, N-95 or Cloth Mask and will complete the other tests 2 atleast 1 day       apart. Subjects will be instructed to abstain from exercise for 2 days before the test.       Mask:       3M 8200 N-95 Respirator obtain from a third party provider. N-95 Respirators have been       purchased outside the Cleveland Clinic supply chain. Cloth Face Mask manufactured by Boco is       a custom designed two-layer face masks are built with a tightly woven polyester outer shell       fabric and a soft, breathable performance knit mesh inner linig. Includes a slit pocket where       a filter can be added.     ","       This study intends to find out how a cloth mask may impact exercise capacity, to provide       guidance for exercisers to adjust their expectations and training accordingly. The       investigators plan to asses exercise capacity through estimated peak oxygen consumption       (eVO2peak), oxygen saturation and level of perceived exertion during treadmill based exercise       while wearing a cloth mask compared to exercising without a cloth mask. The potential       significance of this study is to determine if subjects can exercise safely and if their       exercise training needs to be adjusted while following the current recommendations of wearing       a cloth mask in public. The degree of airflow limitation experienced will depend on the type       and fit of the mask being worn, and inadequeate airflow could possibly result in CO2       re-breathing if all air was not fully discharged from the mask with each breath. This       re-breathing of CO2 could potentially limit the workload leading to a detriment in       performance, and increase in adverse symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness, chest pain       or shortness of breath that does not improve with rest.     ",To gain further understanding on effects exercising with a cloth mask has on exercise capacity. Our working hypothesis is that wearing a face mask will limit exercise capacity by a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 1 estimated Metabolic Equivalent (eMET 3.5 O2 ml/kg/min).,Exercise Capacity,Cleveland Clinic; Cleveland; Ohio; 44195,""

Patients with hypertension, diabetes,       coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular illness, lung disease and kidney dysfunction       commonly have elevated levels of plasmin/plasminogen and it was proposed that this may be the       mechanism for poorer outcomes in patients with these co-morbidities. A logical treatment that       might blunt this process would be the inhibition of the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin.       There is an inexpensive, commonly used drug, tranexamic acid, (TXA), which suppresses this       conversion and could be re-purposed for the treatment of COVID19.       TXA is a synthetic analog of the amino acid lysine which reversibly binds four to five lysine       receptor sites on plasminogen. This reduces conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, and is       normally used to prevent fibrin degradation. TXA is FDA approved for treatment of heavy       menstrual bleeding (typical dose 1300 mg p.o. three times per day x 5 days) and off-label use       for many other indications. TXA is used perioperatively as a standard-of-care at the       University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) for orthopedic and cardiac bypass surgeries. At our       institution, it is commonly employed in hemorrhaging trauma patients and currently is being       studied for perioperative use in Cesarean section surgeries. It has also been utilized for       spinal surgery, neurosurgery, orthognathic surgeries and even long term for the treatment of       cosmetic dermatological disorders with a long track record of safety. Given the potential       benefit and limited toxicity of TXA it would appear warranted to perform a rapid randomized,       double-blind placebo controlled exploratory trial at UAB in the treatment of the early phases       of COVID19 to determine whether it reduces infectivity and virulence of the COVID19 virus as       hypothesized.

","       This phase II expanded access trial will study how well tocilizumab works in reducing the       serious symptoms including pneumonitis (severe acute respiratory distress) in patients with       cancer and COVID-19. COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. COVID-19 can be associated       with an inflammatory response by the immune system which may also cause symptoms of COVID-19       to worsen. This inflammation may be called cytokine storm, which can cause widespread       problems in the body. Tocilizumab is a medicine designed to block the action of a protein       called interleukin-6 (IL-6) that is involved with the immune system and is known to be a key       factor for problems with excessive inflammation. Tocilizumab is effective in treating       cytokine storm from a type of cancer immunotherapy and may be effective in reducing the       inflammatory response and cytokine storm seen in severe COVID-19 disease.

In a subgroup of participants, the investigators will examine the acute effect of postural       therapy (15-degree incline on hospital beds) on oxyhemoglobin saturation among hypoxic       patients to establish a biologic response. The investigators will enroll a subset of       participants (n=16) who will lie supine on hospital beds, which will be placed in the       horizontal (flat) or 15-degree inclined (reverse Trendelenberg) orientation in random order.       During this time, the investigators will continuous record pulse oximetry, pulse rate and       variations in peripheral arterial tone with WatchPAT one devices. Subjects will be visually       monitored for work of breathing during this time. If work of breathing becomes excessive, as       defined as a sustain respiratory rate of >25 and an increase of >5 breaths per minute from       baseline, or oxygenation decreases below 88% for > 30 seconds in the inclined position, then       maneuvers will be stopped. If the patient meets these criteria in the flat position, then the       investigators sit the patient upright, and allow breathing to return to baseline before       examining responses in the inclined position.       The investigators will randomize participants to have beds placed in 15-degree incline or       usual care (ad-lib positioning) for 72 hours. During the first night in a subgroup of       participants, the investigators will record oxygenation, sleep wake state and markers of       sympathetic activity with WatchPAT One devices, which can obtain cardiopulmonary parameters       with high temporal resolution. The investigators will obtain vital signs from the data       warehouse, which archives telemetry data with a maximum sampling frequency of 1 minute. The       investigators will record adherence with continuous accelerometry sensors placed on the bed       rails and on the anterolateral surface of participants'' chests to measure bed and       participants'' positions, respectively. Aside from position, participants will receive usual       treatment for COVID-19.       The investigators will enroll in 3 phases. At the end of each phase, the investigators will       assess for completion of milestones for proceeding to the subsequent phase, as detailed       below:         1. Pilot Study: The investigators will pilot the study in 16 participants to obtain            critical information on logistics of conducting the trial including performance of            recording instruments in a biocontainment environment, to examine the feasibility of the            intervention, perform preliminary safety evaluations to ascertain potential harm and to            determine whether the intervention results in a meaningful difference in body position.         2. Phase II RCT: If inclined therapy results in a difference in body position and no            significant safety issues were detected, the investigators will conduct a phase II            randomized-controlled trial (RCT) in 70 participants (see sample size calculation below)            to estimate the effect size of inclined position on rates of intubation and determine            sample size for a Phase III trial.       Randomization will be occur in both phases and will be stratified by study phase and study       site.     ","       COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 with a range of symptoms from mild,       self-limiting respiratory tract infections to severe progressive pneumonia, multiorgan       dysfunction and death. A portion of individuals with COVID-19 experience life-threatening       hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation. Management of hypoxia in       this population is complicated by contraindication of non-invasive ventilation and       limitations in access to mechanical ventilation and critical care staff given the clinical       burden of disease. Positional therapy is readily deployable and may ultimately be used to       treat COVID-19 related respiratory failure in resources limited settings; and, it has been       demonstrated to improve oxygenation and is easy to implement in the clinical setting.       The overall goal of this randomized controlled trial is to establish the feasibility of       performing a randomized trial using a simple, minimally invasive positional therapy approach       to improve hypoxia and reduce progression to mechanical ventilation. The objectives are to       examine the effectiveness and feasibility of maintaining an inclined position in patients       with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 associated hypoxemic respiratory failure. The       investigators hypothesize that (1) oxyhemoglobin saturation will improve with therapy, (2)       participants will tolerate and adhere to the intervention, and that (3) participants who       adhere to positional therapy will have reduced rates of mechanical ventilation at 72 hours.       If successful, this feasibility trial will demonstrate that a simple, readily deployed       nocturnal postural maneuver is well tolerated and reverses underlying defects in ventilation       and oxygenation due to COVID-19. It will also inform the design of a pivotal Phase III trial       with estimates of sample sizes for clinically relevant outcomes.

Feelings of loneliness, or perceived social isolation, have often been cited as accompanying       objective social isolation. Prior research has established a link between loneliness and a       variety of mental health outcomes including increased depressive symptoms, increased stress       reactivity, and increased risk of suicidal thoughts and attempts.       The urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic thus necessitates the investigation of potential       short-term interventions for loneliness. Research has suggested that longer-term mindfulness       interventions may be effective in mitigating feelings of loneliness and its concomitant       mental health outcomes. The proposed study seeks to determine the preliminary efficacy of a       one-session mindfulness-based telehealth intervention for loneliness during COVID-19. To       increase the potency of this mindfulness-based intervention, the investigators aim to       incorporate compassion motivated social engagement.       There is ample evidence that mindfulness alone is an effective intervention method for       addressing loneliness. However, inclusion of a compassion component may amplify the effects       of an intervention on loneliness because prior research has found that less compassion is       associated with greater loneliness. To date, no research has explicitly tested the effect of       incorporating compassion into a mindfulness intervention for reducing feelings of loneliness.     ","       The primary aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of a one-session, hour-long       HIPAA-compliant video platform-based mindfulness + compassion telehealth intervention on       reducing feelings of loneliness during COVID-19 quarantine. Participants (n=120) currently       isolating due to COVID-19 will be randomized to one of three interventions: (a) mindfulness +       compassion (MC); (b) mindfulness alone (MO); and (c) waitlist control (WL).       The investigators predict that participants in the active intervention groups (mindfulness or       mindfulness + compassion) will show a significantly greater reduction in subjective feelings       of loneliness at one week follow-up compared to those in the waitlist control group.       Additionally, investigators predict that participants in the active intervention groups will       show a significantly greater reduction in stress at one week follow-up compared to those in       the waitlist control group. Last, investigators predict that participants in the mindfulness       + compassion group will show a significantly greater reduction in subjective feelings of       loneliness at the 2-week follow-up follow-up relative to those in the mindfulness only group.

Based on past       epidemics and on emerging data, anxiety and depression rates will increase, along with anger,       grief, somatic complaints, and post-traumatic stress. Coping skills will be challenged,       particularly as anxiety, uncertainty, and personal loss increase.       While anxiety is a healthy response to danger, excessive anxiety can be debilitating and       impair our coping skills. Illness anxiety may also increase given concerns about infection       risks to self and others.       This randomized on-line study is for individuals with anxiety and distress triggered by       COVID-19 who have not yet been infected with the novel corona virus. .       The primary study goal is to examine the extent to which anxiety can be reduced through the       use of on-line training programs. All participants will receive Anxiety Reduction Training       using cognitive-behavioral methods known to be helpful in reducing stress, anxiety,       depression, and insomnia. In addition, two-thirds of participants will be randomly assigned       to receive training in either Kundalini Yoga (KY) or mindfulness meditation. The       investigators will assess the degree to which each of these training programs lead to reduced       stress, improved well-being, decreased multisystem symptoms, enhanced mood, and reduced       cognitive complaints. Participants will complete self-report assessments at 2-week intervals       during the 8 weeks of the acute phase of the study and then again 3- and 6-months later.       The current study may reveal that addressing emergent anxiety early through online       self-guided treatment approaches can lead to improved short- and long-term outcome.

The emergence of       SARS-CoV-2 has led to a pandemic with a wide range of manifestations. One of the hallmarks of       severe illness is the presence of elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers, coagulopathy,       and lymphopenia. Lymphopenia is a robust and consistent predictor of mortality in COVID-19.       Understanding the intersection of inflammation, complement activation, endothelial damage,       and coagulation is critical to a better understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.       This is a multisite study that will conducted at the National Institutes of Health Clinical       Center and other local hospitals. We will recruit patients with mild to severe COVID-19, as       well as patients who have recently recovered from the disease. Participants will have 1-2       study visits to have blood drawn via venipuncture or available venous access, with optional       leukapheresis, nasal and rectal swabs, and echocardiogram for recovered patients. Blood will       be used for genetic testing, lymphocyte phenotyping, soluble biomarker analysis, and other       research tests. Clinical and laboratory data from routine care (eg, basic demographic       information, vital signs, medications, clinical labs, and radiologic imaging) will also be       collected.     ","       Background:       COVID-19 is an acute respiratory syndrome. One symptom of COVID-19 is a reduction in the       number of cells called lymphocytes in the blood. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell       that fights infections. With fewer lymphocytes, the body cannot effectively fight back       against SARS CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Researchers want to better understand how       SARS-CoV-2 affects these blood cells. This information may give them ideas for new       treatments.       Objective:       To learn more about how SARS-CoV-2 affects lymphocytes, the immune, and the blood clotting       system.       Eligibility:       Adults age 18 and older who either currently have COVID-19 or have recently recovered from it       Design:       Participants will give a blood sample. For this, a needle is used to collect blood from an       arm vein. For participants who have a central line, blood will be collected through that       instead.       Participants medical records related to COVID-19 will be reviewed.       Participants who have recovered from COVID-19 will be asked to undergo leukapheresis to       collect white blood cells. For this, blood is taken from a needle placed in one arm. A       machine separates out the white blood cells. The rest of the blood is returned to the       participant through a needle placed in the other arm. This takes about 2-3 hours.       Recovered participants may have material collected from inside the nostrils and/or rectum.       This is done by gently rubbing the area with a sterile cotton swab.       Recovered participants may have an echocardiogram to look at their heart. For this, a small       probe is held against the chest to get pictures of the heart from different angles. This       takes less than 30 minutes.       Participation lasts 1-2 days on most cases and may be split in a few visits for recovered       patients if leukapheresis and echocardiogram are done.       ...

Both the physical and psychosocial consequences of spinal cord injury may negatively       impact one''s ability to accomplish activities of daily living, fully participate in       occupations, and fulfill social roles. People with SCI are at a greater risk for major health       conditions such as heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes than the       population without disabilities. Approximately 30% of individuals with SCI are also at risk       for developing negative mood states that include depression, anxiety, and anger. These       negative mood states can also increase the risk of poor health outcomes, including increased       medical complications, decreased independence in self-care, and decreased productivity.       People with SCI also often require a great deal of supports and services to live       independently within the community, such as a personal care attendant to assist with       activities of daily living, access to accessible transportation, access to medical care, and       access to repair services for their mobility device. Many of these supports and services are       difficult to obtain in the community, medical institutions, and businesses when everything is       operating in a regular capacity. With the changes in daily operations related to the COVID-19       pandemic there are many concerns about whether vulnerable populations like persons with SCI       will be able to access the supports and services they need, this project will give the       investigators information about what the needs are and whether they are being met.     ","       Persons with spinal cord injury (PwSCI) are at a greater risk for major health conditions and       poorer health outcomes than persons without spinal cord injury (SCI). They often experience a       great deal of health needs both on a physiological level as well as a psychosocial level.       PwSCI frequently require supports and services to be able to live independently within the       community. These services and supports are sometimes difficult to access within the community       when the country is operating under regular capacity, in current times with the global       COVID-19 pandemic, the challenges for obtaining and accessing supports and services will       become much greater. The proposed project aims to identify the specific needs during this       time of crisis and to provide referrals and resources to ameliorate those needs by surveying       PwSCI in the St. Louis region. The project also hopes to determine if these persons       experience isolation during shelter at home orders. PwSCI, who the investigators serve or       have served in the past, will be contacted via phone or e-mail once a month for six months       and asked to complete a questionnaire that will allow the investigators to track the       participant''s needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Following the first case detection in the United States on January 20, 2020,       there has been a steady rise in the reported cases resulting in all 50 states being affected       by the disease. As of April 28, 2020, two million deaths globally have been attributed to       this disease. This is an ongoing pandemic, and our understanding of it is continually       evolving.       Measures such as social distancing and working remotely have been enforced worldwide to curb       disease transmission. This has led to an increased number of people staying indoors and       living a more sedentary lifestyle. Many clinicians and people in the community have raised       concerns about maintaining good mental and emotional health along with physical health.       Amidst concerns for maintenance of holistic health, yoga in its forms of guided breathing,       meditation, and mindfulnessare interventions people are practicing rigorously in the current       times of uncertainty. These interventions require no external infrastructure, promote a sense       of calm and well-being, improve sleep quality, and reduce stress and anxiety.       Need for the study:       The study aims at collecting information on the prevalence of COVID 19 infection in seasoned       yoga practitioners and comparing it with the prevalence of COVID-19 infection prevalence       rates among age and gender matched control participants.       The study hypothesizes that yoga practice promotes protection and enhances recovery from the       COVID-19 infection. To prove the hypothesis, the study investigators intend to collect and       compare responses from seasoned yoga practitioners and age and gender matched controls       regarding their recovery from the COVID 19 infection. Based on validated questionnaires on       perceived stress, anxiety, depression, well-being, mindfulness, joy disposition, and       resilience in participants over the study duration, the study investigators also intend to       collect information on participant''s mental and emotional predispositions.       Through this Randomized Controlled Trial, the following specific aims are to be accomplished:       Specific Aim 1: To compare prevalence rates of diagnosed COVID-19 infection between the       seasoned yoga practitioners and age and gender matched controls at baseline and at 6 and 12       weeks.

Characterize patient factors, such as pre-existing comorbidities, cancer type and       treatment, and demographic factors, associated with short- and long-term outcomes of severe       acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (COVID-19), including severity and fatality,       in cancer patients undergoing treatment.       II. Describe cancer treatment modifications made in response to COVID-19, including dose       adjustments, changes in symptom management, or temporary or permanent cessation.       III. Evaluate the association of COVID-19 with cancer outcomes in patient subgroups defined       by clinico-pathologic characteristics.       CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:       I. Future correlative biomarker objectives will include assessment of the development of SARS       coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) antibodies, description of the trajectory of cytokine       abnormalities, and genome-wide association studies to define polymorphisms associated with       severe COVID-19.       II. Future correlative imaging objectives will include assessment of COVID-19 sequelae in       cancer patients.       III. Collection and banking of research blood specimens and radiological images for future       research.       OUTLINE:       Patients undergo collection of medical information about COVID-19 symptoms, treatments/cancer       treatments and outcomes, and results from laboratory tests and imaging scans performed as       part of routine care for up to 2 years. Patients also undergo collection of blood samples at       up to 9 times at the same times they receive routine bloodwork. Patients who are hospitalized       for COVID-19 undergo collection of blood samples at up to 6 additional times.     ","       This study collects blood samples, medical information, and medical images from patients who       are being treated for cancer and have a positive test for SARS CoV-2, the new coronavirus       that causes the disease called COVID-19. Collecting blood samples, medical information, and       medical images may help researchers determine how COVID-19 affects the outcomes of patients       undergoing cancer treatment and how having cancer affects COVID-19.     ","Distinguish the likelihood of severe COVID19 (for example, requiring hospitalization, requiring intensive care unit [ICU] treatment or requiring a ventilator) and death due to COVID-19 for patients with versus without the factor. Among subgroups of at least 50 patients, evaluate using chi-square tests as well as death and hospitalization rates.",Patient variables (factors) associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) severity,21st Century Oncology-Fort Apache;

As part of remote examinations, patients       may be expected to perform home eye testing for visual acuity and the use of various home       visual acuity charts have been proposed to provide clinicians with this vital data. However,       the use of home visual acuity exams has not been validated in our patient population. This       project aims to determine the efficacy and validity of measuring visual acuity at home with a       printed-out ETDRS chart.       Project Description Rationale: Many ophthalmology visits are being conducted remotely via       telehealth. The use of home ETDRS charts is being proposed for patients to report their       visual acuity. However, the efficacy and validity of this method in our population should be       determined.       Objective: Determine the efficacy and validity of measuring visual acuity at home with a       printed-out ETDRS chart in the population served by Vanderbilt Eye Institute. Our hypothesis       is that measuring visual acuity at home with a printed-out ETDRS is non-inferior to visual       acuity measurements by a trained technician in the clinic.       Methodology: The study population will include patients scheduled for in-person visits for       various subspecialties (Glaucoma, Retina/Uveitis, Pediatrics and Cornea) at Vanderbilt Eye       Institute''s (VEI) Nashville campus during the period of 4/27/20-5/27/20. Patients will be       excluded if they have a last best corrected visual acuity worse than 20/200, have not       activated a My Health at Vanderbilt (MHAV) account, or do not speak English. Patients will       also need to be between the ages of 18-90 to Approximately one week prior to their       appointments, patients will be called to obtain e-consent and provide detailed instructions       for measuring best corrected visual acuity at home with the ETDRS chart that is calibrated       for 5 feet. Instructions will also be sent via MHAV along with the ETDRS chart and the       consent form. Data collected will include age, sex, and primary ophthalmological diagnosis as       well as last measured Snellen visual acuity (+/-3months). The department, provider, and date       of the in-person appointment will also be collected. Patients will be instructed to complete       a home visual acuity check two-four days prior to appointment and send a message through MHAV       with the results. Participants will record the smallest full line ( 5 letters) in each eye       that they can read. If a message is not received two days prior to the appointment, a       research assistant will call the patient back to reconfirm the plan. At the in-person visit,       patients will begin their encounter with an ETDRS assessment at VEI, using the ETDRS chart at       20 feet. Again, the full line of 5 letters read will be used for analysis. Patients will       receive a survey to be completed in clinic with a 5-point Likert scale to rate the ease of       home visual acuity as well as a short response question about barriers to assessment.       Data Management and Analysis: Data will be collected from the electronic health record (EHR)       and kept in a password-protected deidentified Excel document. Visual acuities will be       converted to logMAR for analysis.       Ethical Considerations: There are no ethical considerations to report.       Barriers to Home Visual acuity testing         -  Poor/no access to the technical requirements - computer, printer, internet         -  Do not feel confident of being able to test vision accurately at home         -  Attempted to test vision at home but was unable to follow instructions completely         -  Do not want to try it at home, medical procedures should be done in a clinic         -  Vision too poor to perform these tasks       The Home visual acuity test was easy to set up and perform         1.

Participants       will be randomized either to the investigational arm (therapeutic anticoagulation with       heparin for 14 days or until recovery [defined as hospital discharge or liberation from       supplemental oxygen if initially required], whichever comes first), or to the control arm       (usual care, including thromboprophylactic dose anticoagulation according to local practice).     ","       Endothelial injury as a consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to a dysregulated host       inflammatory response and activation of coagulation pathways. Macro- and micro-vascular       thrombosis may contribute to morbidity, organ failure, and death. Therapeutic anticoagulation       with heparin may improve clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 through anti-thrombotic,       anti-inflammatory, and anti-viral activities of heparins. This pragmatic, Bayesian adaptive       randomized controlled trial will determine whether therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin       (subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin or intravenous unfractionated heparin) versus       usual care reduces the need for intubation or death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19       not initially requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. The trial uses an adaptive design       which was chosen to overcome limitations in available data to inform a priori estimation of       event rates and possible effect sizes. The adaptive design also includes response-adaptive       randomization based on baseline D-dimer level, probing for differential efficacy across       subgroups defined based on initial D-dimer level.

Such information is       necessary to understand how to most logically intervene with directly acting antiviral agents       and immunologic response modifiers. The variability of the clinical course of patients who       may be asymptomatic throughout their clinical course to those patients who develop       progressive multisystem organ failure represents a challenge to understand the host and viral       factors that result in these dramatically different outcomes.       This protocol will enroll patients to the Clinical Center in a longitudinal study using       granular clinical, laboratory, and imaging data including extensive pulmonary and cardiac       functional assessments, neurologic evaluation, comprehensive immunologic evaluations, and       innovative imaging. In patients with COVID-19 infection, linking sequential analysis of       blood, urine and bronchoalveolar lavage with simultaneous cardiopulmonary imaging can provide       novel insights into mechanisms associated with the initiation, progression and resolution of       lung, cardiac and systemic inflammation.

The COVID-19 public       health crisis requires the full resources and attention of healthcare systems. This has led       to several healthcare changes that affect physicians in training, including changes to       rotations and schedules, risks of infection exposure to themselves or their families, and the       unknown impacts this may have on their residency and fellowship experiences.       These changes are likely impacting their stress, health, and well-being. Physician burnout is       major concern for the medical community and likely to be further impacted by the current       pandemic. Evidence-based interventions for stress include cognitive behavior therapy,       although this can be time consuming, requires the need for specialized providers, and is not       feasible for everyone during this COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmacotherapy can be used, including       antidepressants and anxiolytics, however they have inherent limitations such as side effects,       tolerance, and interactions that limit their use. Consumer based mobile applications (apps)       may help individuals with self-management strategies for stress. Mindfulness meditation is       one type of self-management strategy and is the practice of moment-to-moment awareness in       which the person purposefully focuses on the present without judgement.       Calm is a mobile app that offers a range of meditation lessons, sleep stories (bed-time       stories for grown-ups), sleep music, and nature sounds with modules that vary in length,       instruction, and content. Few studies on the use of Calm exist and include a randomized       controlled trial evaluating its affect to decrease stress among college students and a       descriptive study evaluating cancer patient''s perceptions of the app. There is evidence to       support the use of similar apps in resident physicians. A pilot study assessing the effects       of a meditation app on resident wellness suggested both the feasibility and efficacy of such       an intervention. During these unprecedented times of the COVID-19 pandemic, mobile apps such       as Calm may be potentially beneficial to help with stress in house staff physicians, although       this requires further investigation.     ","       Due to the COVID-19 global health pandemic, many people are likely experiencing increased       stress. The well-being of physicians in training may be significantly impacted by this       pandemic. Meditation is a self-management strategy that can be utilized by anyone to assist       with the management of stress. Meditation mobile applications, such as the Calm app, can be       used to help manage stress, especially during this uncertain time. The investigators propose       a prospective evaluation of perceived stress, anxiety, burnout and sleep disturbance in the       house staff at Banner University Medical Center Phoenix, with the use of the mobile       meditation app, Calm.

Conventional medical therapy, including intensive care and       respiratory support is associated with an 80% mortality. Aviptadil, a synthetic form of Human       Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) has been awarded FDA Orphan Drug Designation for the       treatment of ARDS and admitted to the FDA CoronaVirus Technology Accelerator Program.       VIP binds to VPAC1 receptors on the pulmonary Alveolar Type II (ATII) cell. ATII cells       comprise only 5% of lung epithelial cells but are critical for oxygen transfer, surfactant       production, and maintenance of Alveolar Type 1 cells. 70% of VIP binds to this receptor. The       Type II cell is also the cell selectively attacked by the SARS-CoV-2 virus via the ACE2       surface receptor.       Nonclinical studies demonstrate that VIP is highly concentrated in the lung and specifically       bound to the ATII cell, where it prevents NMDA-induced caspase-3 activation in the lung,       inhibits IL6 and TNFa production, protects against HCl-induced pulmonary edema, and       upregulates surfactant production, These and other effects have been observed in numerous       animal model systems of lung injury in mice, rats, guinea pigs, sheep, swine, and dogs. In       these models, Aviptadil restores barrier function at the endothelial/alveolar interface and       thereby protects the lung and other organs from failure.       Aviptadil ihas a demonstrated 20 year history of safety in phase 2 trials for Sarcoid,       Pulmonary Fibrosis, Bronchospasm, and a phase I trial in ARDS. In that phase I trial, 8       patients with severe ARDS on mechanical ventilation were treated with ascending doses of VIP.       Seven of the 8 patients were successfully extubated and were alive at the five day timepoint.       Six left the hospital and one died of an unrelated cardiac event.       Five phase 2 trials of aviptadil have been conducted under European regulatory authority.       Numerous healthy volunteer studies have shown that i.v. infusion of Aviptadil is well       tolerated with few adverse effects including alterations in blood pressure, heart rate, or       ECG. In addition to published studies of human use, Aviptadil has been used on a compounded       basis in certain ICUs for many years in the belief that it preserves life and restores       function in pulmonary hypertension, ARDS, and Acute Lung Injury (ALI).       In this study, patients who are hospitalized for Critical COVID-19 infection with respiratory       failure will be randomly allocated to Aviptadil administered by intravenous infusion in       addition to maximal intensive care vs. maximal intensive care alone. Primary endpoints will       be improvement in blood oxygenation and mortality.     ","       Novel Corona Virus (SARS-CoV-2) is known to cause Respiratory Failure, which is the hallmark       of Acute COVID-19, as defined by the new NIH/FDA classification. Approximately 50% of those       who develop Critical COVID-19 die, despite intensive care and mechanical ventilation.       Patients with Critical COVID-19 and respiratory failure, currently treated with high flow       nasal oxygen, non-invasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation will be treated with       Aviptadil, a synthetic form of Human Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) plus maximal       intensive care vs. placebo + maximal intensive care.

Coronavirus RNA was       quickly identified in some of these patients.This novel coronavirus has been designated       SARS-CoV-2, and the disease caused by this virus has been designated COVID-19.Outbreak       forecasting and mathematical modelling suggest that these numbers will continue to rise [1]       in many countries over the coming weeks to months.Global efforts to evaluate novel antivirals       and therapeutic strategies to treat COVID-19 have intensified. There is an urgent public       health need for rapid development of novel interventions. At present, there is no specific       antiviral therapy for coronavirus infections.       Passive immunization:Passive immunization consists in the transfer of antibodies from       immunized donor to non-immunized individual in order to transfer transient protection against       an infective agent. A physiological example of passive immunization is the transfer of       maternal IgG antibodies to the foetus through the placenta to confer humoral protection to       newborns in the first years of life. Passive immunization differs from active immunization in       which the patient develops their own immune response following contact with the infective       agent or vaccine.       Known potential risks and benefits: There is a theoretical risk of antibody-dependent       enhancement of infection (ADE) through which virus targeted by non-neutralizing antibodies       gain entry into macrophages. Another theoretical risk is that antibody administration to       those exposed to SARS-CoV-2 may avoid disease but modify the immune response such that those       individuals mount attenuated immune responses, which would leave them vulnerable to       subsequent re-infection. Finally, there are risks associated with any transfusion of plasma       including transmission of blood transmitted viruses (e.g. HIV, HBV, HCV, etc.), allergic       transfusion reactions, including anaphylaxis, febrile non hemolytic transfusion reaction,       transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion associated cardiac overload       (TACO), and hemolysis should ABO incompatible plasma be administered. Potential benefits of       COVID-19 convalescent plasma include improved survival, improvement in symptoms, decreased       risk in intubation for mechanical ventilation, decrease risk of intensive care unit (ICU)       admission, shortened hospitalization time and suppression of viral load.       Mechanism of action: Transfusion of apheresis frozen plasma (AFP) from COVID-19 convalescent       patients allows the transfer of donor neutralizing antibodies directed against SARS-CoV2       antigens to the recipient, thus allowing the generation of passive immunization. Naturally       produced human antibody are polyclonal, meaning they are directed against a variety of       different viral antigens and epitopes allowing for a general neutralizing effect against the       virus rather than focussing on a specific target. Administration of convalescent plasma has       been associated with rapid decrease in viral load. It is also possible that passive       immunization contributes to improved cell-mediated immunity by favoring the phagocytosis and       presentation of viral antigens to host T cells.       Participant recruitment:Only hospitalized COVID-19 patients are eligible so recruitment       efforts will be focused on identified consecutive patients admitted to hospital with acute       COVID-19 infection. No other external recruitment efforts are planned. At each participating       hospital, a process for identifying patients with COVID-19 will be established.       Donor recruitment for Canadian sites: Recovered COVID-19 patients will be identified as       potential donors in collaboration with provincial public health services, local health       authorities, and individual co-investigators involved in the study. Potential donors may also       be recruiting following self-identification on the routine donor questionnaire or through       social media. They will be contacted by phone and invited to participate in the program as       potential donors. After obtaining verbal consent and reviewing donor selection criteria,       eligible participants will be directed to a Héma-Québec collection or Canadian Blood Services       apheresis collection site in their area to donate.       Criteria for donors: All donors will need to meet the criteria set forth in the Manual of       donor selection criteria in use at Héma-Québec or Canadian Blood ServicesIn addition, donors       will require:         -  Prior diagnosis of COVID-19 documented by a PCR test at time of infection or by positive            anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology following infection         -  Male donors, or female donors with no pregnancy history or with negative anti-HLA            antibodies         -  At least 6 days since last plasma donation         -  Provided informed consent         -  A complete resolution of symptoms at least 14 days prior to donation       Donor recruitment for United States sites: Recovered COVID-19 patients are being recruited       through the New York Blood Center and Weill Cornell Medicine in separate protocols. Potential       donors can self-refer via websites but also be referred by physicians or identified via the       medical record system. Only donors with laboratory-confirmed history of COVID-19 will be       screened. After providing consent and reviewing FDA and NYBC donor eligibility criteria,       donors are screened for the presences of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the nasopharynx if screening       within 14 days of complete resolution in accordance with current FDA guidance. Criteria for       donation are subject to change based on future revision of FDA guidance. Those found to be       eligible will be referred to NYBC for donation.       Criteria for donors:         -  Provision of informed consent         -  Aged 18 to 70 years. Donors are not longer eligible after their 71st birthday.         -  Documented molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR by nasopharyngeal swab,            oropharyngeal swab, or sputum or detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in serum.         -  Complete resolution of COVID-19 symptoms at least 14 days prior to donation         -  Not currently pregnant or pregnant within 6 weeks by self-report         -  Male donors, or females with no pregnancy history or with negative anti-HLA antibodies         -  Meets blood donor criteria specified by NYBC, which is consistent with FDA regulations.       Donors will be allowed to donate every 7 days. The following information will be collection       from donors: ABO group, sex, age, date of onset of symptoms (when available), date of       resolution of symptoms (when available), CCP collection date(s).       Randomization procedures: Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (convalescent plasma vs       standard of care). Patients will be randomized using a secure, concealed, computer-generated,       web-accessed randomization sequence. Randomization will be stratified by centre and age (<60       and ≥ 60 years). Within each stratum, variable permuted block sized will be used. This       approach will ensure that concealment of the treatment sequence is maintained.       Duration of follow-up: Subjects will be followed daily until hospital discharge or death.       Patients discharged from hospital before Day 30 will be contacted by telephone on Day 30 ± 3       days to ascertain any AEs, vital status (dead/alive), hospital readmission and need for       mechanical ventilation after discharge. Patients discharged from hospital will be contacted       at Day 90+/- 7 days to determine vital status. Patients with a prolonged hospital admission       will be censored at Day 90. The local study coordinator will collect all study data and       record the data in the electronic CRF or paper CRF as per study procedures for each site.       Duration of study: For an individual subject, the study ends 90 days after randomization. The       overall study will end when the last randomized subject has completed 90 day follow-up. We       estimate that all patient will be enrolled in a period of 6 months, data on the primary       endpoint will be available 30 days after last patient enrollment and data on all secondary       endpoints will be available after 90-day from last patient enrollment.       Sample size considerations: Assuming a baseline risk of intubation or death of 30% in       hospitalized patients with standard of care, a sample size of 1200 (800 in the convalescent       plasma arm, and 400 in the standard of care arm) would provide 80% power to detect a relative       risk reduction of 25% with convalescent plasma therapy using a 2-tailed test at level α =       0.05 and a 2:1 randomization.       Interim analysis: A single interim analysis is planned when the primary outcome (intubation       or mortality at 30 days) is available for 50% of the target sample. An O''Brien-Fleming       stopping rule will be used at that time, but treated as a guideline, so there is minimal       impact on the threshold for statistical significance for the final significance test of the       primary outcome. A DSMB will monitor ongoing results to ensure patient well-being and safety       as well as study integrity. The DSMB will be asked to recommend early termination or       modification only when there is clear and substantial evidence of a treatment difference.       Final analysis plan: The primary analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat population       which will include data from all individuals who have been randomized. Outcomes will be       attributed to the arm to which individuals were randomized irrespective of whether they       received the planned intervention (e.g. plasma from a convalescent COVID-19 donor).     ","       There is currently no treatment available for COVID-19, the acute respiratory illness caused       by the novel SAR-CoV-2. Convalescent plasma from patients who have recovered from COVID-19       that contains antibodies to the virus is a potential therapy. On March 25th, 2020, the FDA       approved the use of convalescent plasma under the emergency investigational new drug (eIND)       category. Randomized trials are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of COVID-19       convalescent plasma for acute COVID-19 infection.       The objective of the CONCOR-1 trial is to determine the efficacy of transfusion of COVID-19       convalescent plasma to adult patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection at       decreasing the frequency of in-hospital mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.       It is hypothesized that treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma       early in their clinical course will reduce the risk of death, and that other outcomes will be       improved including risk of intubation, and length of ICU and hospital stay.       This pan-Canadian clinical trial has the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce the       burden on health care resources including reducing the need for ICU beds and ventilators.

Other       countries'' experience suggests that 5-16% of COVID-19 in-patients will undergo prolonged       intensive care with 50-70% needing mechanical ventilation(MV) threatening to overwhelm       hospital capacity. ARDS has no effective treatment besides supportive care, the use of       ventilation strategies encompassing low tidal volumes that limit trans-pulmonary pressures,       and prone positioning in severe disease. Most current trials in clinicaltrials.gov for       COVID-19-induced ARDS aim at modulating the inflammatory response or test anti-viral drugs.       Sarilumab and tocilizumab that block IL-6 effects are being tested in RCT for patients       hospitalized with severe COVID-19 (NCT04317092, NCT04322773, NCT04327388). The World Health       Organization international trial SOLIDARITY will test remdesivir; chloroquine +       hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir + ritonavir; and lopinavir + ritonavir and interferon-beta       (NCT04321616). Yet studies targeting the coagulation system, which is intrinsically       intertwined with the inflammatory response are lacking.       A consistent finding in ARDS is the deposition of fibrin in the airspaces and lung       parenchyma, along with fibrin-platelet microthrombi in the pulmonary vasculature, which       contribute to the development of progressive respiratory dysfunction and right heart failure.       Similar to pathologic findings of ARDS, microthrombi have now been observed in lung specimens       from patients infected with COVID-19.       Inappropriate activation of the clotting system in ARDS results from enhanced activation and       propagation of clot formation as well as suppression of fibrinolysis. Our group has shown       that low fibrinolysis is associated with ARDS. Studies starting decades ago have demonstrated       the systemic and local effects of dysfunctional coagulation in ARDS, specifically related to       fibrin. This occurs largely because of excessive amounts of tissue factor that is produced by       alveolar epithelial cells and activated alveolar macrophages, and high levels of plasminogen       activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) produced and released by endothelial cells. Consistent with       this, generalized derangements of the hemostatic system with prolongation of the prothrombin       time, elevated D-dimer and fibrin degradation products have been reported in severely ill       COVID-19 patients, particularly in non-survivors. These laboratory findings, in combination       with the large clot burden seen in the pulmonary microvasculature, mirrors what is seen in       human sepsis, experimental endotoxemia, and massive tissue trauma. Targeting the coagulation       and fibrinolytic systems to improve the treatment of ARDS has been proposed for at least the       past two decades. In particular, the use of plasminogen activators to limit ARDS progression       and reduce ARDS-induced death has received strong support from animal models, and a phase 1       human clinical trial. In 2001, Hardaway and colleagues showed that administration of either       urokinase or streptokinase to patients with terminal ARDS reduced the expected mortality from       100% to 70% with no adverse bleeding events. Importantly, the majority of patients who       ultimately succumbed died from renal or hepatic failure, rather than pulmonary failure.       Consideration of therapies that are widely available but not recognized for this indication       and traditionally considered high-risk such as fibrinolytic agents is warranted in this       unprecedented public health emergency, since the risk of adverse events from tPA is far       outweighed by the extremely high risk of death in the patient''s meeting the eligibility       criteria for this trial. While the prior studies by Hardaway et al evaluating fibrinolytic       therapy for treatment of ARDS used urokinase and streptokinase, the more contemporary       approach to thrombolytic therapy involves the use of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA)       due to higher efficacy of clot lysis with comparable bleeding risk to the other fibrinolytic       agents.     ","       The global pandemic COVID-19 has overwhelmed the medical capacity to accommodate a large       surge of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In the United States, the       number of cases of COVID-19 ARDS is projected to exceed the number of available ventilators.       Reports from China and Italy indicate that 22-64% of critically ill COVID-19 patients with       ARDS will die. ARDS currently has no evidence-based treatments other than low tidal       ventilation to limit mechanical stress on the lung and prone positioning. A new therapeutic       approach capable of rapidly treating and attenuating ARDS secondary to COVID-19 is urgently       needed.       The dominant pathologic feature of viral-induced ARDS is fibrin accumulation in the       microvasculature and airspaces. Substantial preclinical work suggests antifibrinolytic       therapy attenuates infection provoked ARDS. In 2001, a phase I trial 7 demonstrated the       urokinase and streptokinase were effective in patients with terminal ARDS, markedly improving       oxygen delivery and reducing an expected mortality in that specific patient cohort from 100%       to 70%. A more contemporary approach to thrombolytic therapy is tissue plasminogen activator       (tPA) due to its higher efficacy of clot lysis with comparable bleeding risk 8. We therefore       propose a phase IIa clinical trial with two intravenous (IV) tPA treatment arms and a control       arm to test the efficacy and safety of IV tPA in improving respiratory function and       oxygenation, and consequently, successful extubation, duration of mechanical ventilation and       survival.     ","Ideally, the PaO2/FiO2 will be measured with the patient in the same prone/supine position as in baseline, as change in positions may artificially reduce the improvement attributable to the study drug. However, given the pragmatic nature of the trial, the prone/supine position will be determined by the attending physician, in which case, we will use as an outcome the PaO2/FiO2 closest to the 48 hours obtained prior to the change in position as the outcome.",PaO2/FiO2 improvement from pre-to-post intervention,"Denver Health Medical Center; Denver; Colorado; 80204; Ernest E Moore, MD; ernest.moore@dhha.org; 303-602-1820","Ernest E Moore, MD; (303) 602-1820; ernest.moore@dhha.org"

The ICU Recovery Clinic includes a       transdisciplinary team with input from five disciplines that provide coordinated outpatient       care with a focus on medical issues, medication management, nutrition, sleep disruption, and       any issues related to post-intensive care syndrome such as anxiety, depression, PTSD,       cognitive dysfunction and physical impairments.       Individualized physical therapy treatment: After the initial ICU recovery clinic appointment       patients will begin their 8-week physical therapy program which will be delivered 1-2 times       per week in a supervised 1:1 session and supplemented with 3 days of unsupervised home       exercises and walking program on days not participating in physical therapy sessions.       Supervised sessions will be run by a physical therapist (>20 years of experience in ICU and       pulmonary rehabilitation) either face to face in outpatient setting or through telemedicine       using video consultation platforms for patients unable to attend appointments due to       transmission risk, transportation issues, or geographically living >45 miles from clinic.       Prior to commencing the first treatment session patients will complete baseline testing to       inform the starting parameters (frequency, intensity, repetitions) based on performance in       physical tests such as 6MWT and muscle strength testing. The patient will receive an       individualized and tailored physical therapy treatment, which will be targeted towards       increasing their aerobic fitness, muscle strength and functional ability.     ","       Introduction: Survivors of acute respiratory failure develop persistent muscle weakness and       deficits in cardiopulmonary endurance combining to limit physical functioning. Early data       from the Covid-19 pandemic suggest a high incidence of critically ill patients admitted to       intensive care units (ICU) will require mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure.       Covid-19 patients surviving an admission to the ICU are expected to suffer from physical and       cognitive impairments that will limit quality of life and return to pre-hospital level of       functioning. In this present study, the investigators will evaluate the safety and       feasibility of providing a novel clinical pathway combining ICU after-care at an ICU Recovery       clinic with physical therapy interventions.       Methods and Analysis: In this single-center, prospective (pre, post cohort) trial in patients       surviving ICU admission for Covid-19. The investigators hypothesize that this novel       combination is a) safe and feasible to provide for patients surviving Covid-19; b) improve       physical function and exercise capacity measured by performance on 6-minute walk test and       Short Performance Physical battery; and c) reduce incidence of anxiety, depression and       post-traumatic stress assessed with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Impact of       Events Scale-revised. Safety will be assessed by pooled adverse events and reason for early       termination of interventions. Feasibility will be assessed by rate of adherence and       attrition. Repeated measures ANOVA will be utilized to assess change in outcomes from at       first ICU Recovery Clinic follow-up (2-weeks) and 3- and 6-months post hospital discharge.       Ethics and Dissemination: The trial has received ethics approval at the University of       Kentucky and enrollment has begun. The results of this trial will support the feasibility of       providing ICU follow-up and physical therapy interventions for patients surviving critical       illness for Covid-19 and may begin to support effectiveness of such interventions.       Investigators plan to disseminate trial results in peer-reviewed journals, as well as       presentation at physical therapy and critical care national and international conferences.

Multiple healthcare systems and surgical societies       recommended ceasing all elective procedures until this crisis is contained [7-10]. As such,       it will be necessary for hospitals to restructure as surgeries increase to protect surgical       patients from becoming infected. Our study will be the first to define the test conversion       rate of those undergoing surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. The information       gathered from this study can have implications in how surgical centers treat patients during       and after this pandemic.       There has been a single study examining postoperative nosocomial infections during the       initial incubation period in which 100% of patients developed Sars-CoV-2 viral pneumonia, 14       (44%) required ICU admission with mechanical ventilation, and 7 (20.5%) died after ICU       admission [11]. A second cohort of bariatric surgery patients found that 4 of 4 (100%)       developed Sars-CoV-2 infections postoperatively with all patients surviving [12]. Another       retrospective study found that of 305 patients admitted to the digestive surgery service, 15       (4.9%) developed nosocomial Sars-CoV-2 pneumonia [13]. Of this cohort, two patients died, and       seven were hospitalized with six discharged at the time of chart review. Another       retrospective non-operative hospital cohort found that 34 of 102 adult patients contracted       Sars-CoV-2 as a nosocomial infection. In a review of Gynecologic Oncology procedures in Wuhan       the overall nosocomial infection rate was 1.59% (3/189) with two of the three patients being       discharged by the publication date [14]. However, in a retrospective review of a general       hospital ward in Hong Kong in which the staff used ''vigilant basic infection control       measures'' 10 patients and 7 staff members that met the definition for close contact were       identified and through contact tracing 76 tests were performed on 52 contacts with no       Sars-CoV-2 infections identified [15]. Another cohort from Wuhan demonstrated that when       performing regional anesthesia (45/49 for Cesarean Section), no anesthetists were infected       when complying with level 3 PPE [16].         1.

Beginning on March 16th, 2020 Northwell Health postponed all elective surgeries.       As the incidence of COVID-19 cases begins to decrease and hospital volume improves we need to       ensure the safety of our patients planning surgical procedures. However, at this time there       is a scarcity of data regarding the COVID-19 test conversion rate in surgical patients. Our       goal is to determine the COVID-19 test conversion rate in these patients to better guide       strategies for restarting surgical care in a large-scale pandemic.       Patients will be routinely tested with serology and PCR for COVID-19 24-48 hours prior to       their scheduled surgery. Those who provide informed consent will be re-tested 12-16 days       after discharge from the hospital to determine any potential nosocomial infection rate.       Patients will also answer a few questions during their retest to allow the study team to       gauge exposure risk postoperatively after leaving the hospital.

Emerging evidence suggests that a subset of patients with       COVID-19 develops a cytokine storm syndrome that is associated with elevation of       pro-inflammatory cytokines.       Catecholamines enhance inflammatory injury by augmenting the production of IL-6 and other       cytokines through a self-amplifying feed-forward loop in immune cells that requires alpha-1       adrenergic receptor (⍺1-AR) signaling. The ⍺1-AR antagonist prazosin prevents cytokine storm       and markedly increased survival following inflammatory stimuli in preclinical models. In a       retrospective study of outcomes in acute respiratory distress syndrome or pneumonia, patients       who were taking ⍺1-AR antagonists had significantly lower probability of needing invasive       mechanical ventilation and dying in the hospital compared to non-users.       Prazosin may blunt surges in catecholamines and self-amplifying cytokine production       (including interleukin 6) and, as an early preemptive therapy in patients prior to disease       progression, may prevent cytokine storm syndrome and severe complications of COVID-19.       In this study, patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 testing who are hospitalized (but are not       requiring more than 4 liters/minute of supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula) will be screened       for eligibility. Patients who provide informed consent and meet eligibility requirements will       be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either prazosin or standard of care. Participants       randomized to the study drug will receive prazosin for 28 days and all patients will be       followed for a total of 60 days to capture outcomes.

","       An increased risk of both venous and arterial thromboembolism was noted in reports from       SARS-CoV-2-infected patients in China and has been confirmed in autopsy findings from       patients who experienced sudden death. Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs), which encompass       polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis, are thrombophilic       disorders with a natural propensity to thrombosis that is fuelled by the intrinsic activation       of inflammatory cytokines. It therefore follows that an underlying diagnosis of MPN may       increase the risk of worse clinical outcomes and death during periods of active Covid-19       disease. This ambispective, observational study aims to elucidate the key factors which       affect the clinical course of patients with MPN who develop Covid-19 disease.

Cincinnati only recently       (March 14, 2020) had its first confirmed case of COVID-19, and through shelter-in-place and       social distancing efforts, has avoided the community spread experienced by some other large       metropolitan areas. As investigators contemplate the gradual reintroduction of the Cincinnati       Children''s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) workforce back into the hospital, it is imperative       that investigators determine the current prevalence of infection among CCHMC employees,       measure the cumulative incidence of infection over the next 12 months, investigate the normal       antibody patterns after infection, and help elucidate what constitutes a protective       immunological response. Investigators have a unique but time-limited opportunity to optimally       track the epidemiology and natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection at CCHMC, including risk       factors for transmission and immunological recovery. RETURN will investigate epidemiological       and immunological features of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in a limited cohort of CCHMC       employees, as they return from the current shelter-at-home directive toward a normal work       environment. By collecting and analyzing weekly serial samples for SARS-CoV-2 (nasal swab for       virus by PCR) and monthly serological exposure (serum antibodies by ELISA), investigators       will determine the prevalence and cumulative incidence of exposure to SARS-CoV-2; document       the antibody responses over time; identify cases of apparent viral recrudescence or       re-infection; and create models of transmission risk among CCHMC employees.     ","       The purpose of this research study is 1) to conduct a prospective longitudinal surveillance       research trial, enrolling up to 200 CCHMC employees as they come back to work, and then       following their clinical and laboratory parameters for up to 12 months; and 2) to support the       ongoing development of diagnostic techniques for COVID-19. The overall goal is to investigate       patterns of SARS-COV-2 infection, including immunological recovery and genetic risk factors,       among CCHMC employees to better understand how to safely reintroduce the CCHMC work force       back into their normal routines.

NCT04382391,2020-05-08,Recruiting,N/A,Interventional,Study Assessing Vagus Nerve Stimulation in CoViD-19 Respiratory Symptoms,"A Prospective, Randomized, Controlled Study Assessing Vagus Nerve Stimulation in CoViD-19 Respiratory Symptoms (SAVIORII)","ARDS, Human|COVID|Corona Virus Infection|Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult|Respiratory Failure|SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)",Standard of care therapies;gammaCore® Sapphire (non-invasive vagus nerve stimulator),All,18,,No,15212,Treatment,Randomized,Parallel Assignment,,None (Open Label),"       Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has an established history of reducing airway distress. VNS has       at least two mechanisms of action that may profoundly affect respiratory function in patients       with respiratory distress due to CoViD-19.       First, vagus nerve stimulation modulates bronchoconstriction, acute stimulation has       demonstrated a marked improvement in Work of Breathing (WOB) as well as Forced Expiratory       Volume (FEV1) in patients with severe respiratory distress due to airway reactivity. This       effect appears to occur via an afferent response to stimulation of the vagus nerve.       Second, and perhaps more importantly, VNS has been shown to be a potent moderator of       pathologic immune reactions, specifically suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine levels via       activation of the Cholinergic Anti-inflammatory Pathway (CAP). VNS is currently being studied       to modulate pro-inflammatory cytokines patterns and concentrations in a variety of acute and       progressive inflammatory conditions, ranging from septic shock and asthma to stroke,       rheumatoid arthritis and Inflammatory Bowel Disease. VNS has been studied in animal models of       acute septic shock, consistently demonstrating life-saving potential. In one such study,       cecal ligation and puncture was used to induce a septic state in an animal model. VNS reduced       the expression of cytokines which was tightly associated with survival. Specifically, in       animal and human models, this neuromodulatory therapy has the capacity to reduce the       expression of inflammatory mediators, including TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β. These are precisely       the same cytokines which are elevated in ARDS and other inflammatory disorders. In all cases,       the therapy has shown considerable promise as a potential alternative to steroids (having       potent anti-inflammatory activity but without the adverse side effects of steroids) and       biologic therapies targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines (broadly - e.g., tofacitinib, or       specifically - e.g., adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab).       Viral-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including those caused by SARS       CoV-1 and MERS are characterized by a massive systemic pro-inflammatory state. Although a       pro-inflammatory environment is required to control the rate of infection as well as the       eradication of infected and compromised cells, the massive response to these viruses,       primarily due to leukocytes of the innate arm of the immune system, is part of the problem as       a significant number of tissues are damaged and lost secondary to the infected tissues in a       by-stander and collateral manner. A simple, drug-free approach to attenuate this systemic       inflammation would be of significant benefit to the progression of the syndrome and       potentially improve the overall recovery of the patients.       For these reasons, the investigators propose that VNS may ameliorate the over-activity of the       pro-inflammatory immune condition in CoViD-19 patients, thus conferring a superior       therapeutic option especially for elderly patients and those presenting with respiratory       illness in setting of co-morbid conditions who experience severe symptoms. These groups are       at particularly high risk of requiring mechanical ventilation, developing ARDS, experiencing       severe cytokine storm and have a higher mortality rate.       Non-Invasive Vagus Nerve Stimulation (nVNS) - Historically, VNS was delivered using implanted       signal generators coupled to leads having electrodes that wrap around the vagus nerve. The       vagus nerve is located within the carotid sheath, and thus the implantation surgery is       complicated with inherent risks, particularly in the critically ill. More recently, a       non-invasive approach to vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) was cleared by the FDA for the acute       treatment of pain associated episodic cluster and migraine headaches and the prevention of       cluster headaches and migraine headaches. This device, gammaCore (electroCore, Inc., Basking       Ridge, NJ) is handheld and requires no surgery or implants. The device is applied by       healthcare providers or patients to the skin at the neck over the vagus nerve to deliver       periodic doses of VNS non-invasively.       With respect to bronchoconstriction, early studies demonstrated modulation of airway       reactivity in hospitalized asthmatic patients, improving various measures of airway patency.       Non-invasive VNS (nVNS) is a safe method of stimulating the vagus nerve, with minimal side       effects. It does not require surgery or an invasive procedure that would otherwise limit its       utility in the critically ill. The stimulation can be either self-administered or       administered by a health care practitioner. There are numerous studies with both implanted       and nVNS in multiple animal models and humans that have demonstrated a modulation of the       inflammatory cascade with an improvement in survival.       gammaCore® (nVNS) has been studied in approximately 2,000 patients as part of clinical trials       with an excellent safety profile. It is available through commercial insurers and the private       pay market, and is listed on the federal supply schedule available for purchase by the VA and       Department of Defense and also carries a CE mark for distribution abroad. More than ten       thousand patients have been successfully treated in the United States and abroad.       CoViD-19 Respiratory Issues Involve Virally-triggered Severe (Lethal) Cytokine Expression -       CoViD-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is caused by SARS CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory       syndrome coronavirus 2) and is related to the coronavirus which caused SARS in 2003 (SARS       CoV-1). The virus is transmitted either through airborne droplets (e.g. coughing or sneezing)       or direct contact (e.g. through a surface containing the virus), with a mean incubation       period between 4 and 7 days (range 2 days to > 2 weeks). As of April 3, 2020, there are over       a million confirmed cases and rising with 55,000 individuals deceased to date. This gives a       current mortality rate of 5.3 %, although the base case of confirmed cases may be markedly       underestimated. Elderly and those with co-morbid conditions including heart disease,       diabetes, and asthma seem to have a higher mortality rate.       Many CoViD-19 patients experience moderate to severe respiratory symptoms, including       shortness of breath and impaired oxygen saturation. Eighty-eight percent (88%) of patients       present with respiratory symptoms. A significant and increasing number of CoViD-19 patients       require hospitalization, and progress to being intubated and/or ventilator dependent. Given       the rapid spread of this contagion, concern exists that the international healthcare systems       do not have the number of ventilators and/or ICU beds to meet the expected demand in the       coming months.       The most critically afflicted can experience pneumonia and/or ARDS. Accumulating evidence       suggests that this subgroup with severe CoViD-19 likely have a cytokine storm syndrome, a       hallmark of ARDS that includes dramatic increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory       cytokines, mainly TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β among others. Elevations in IL-6 seem to be a       particularly poor outcome indicator of respiratory compromise. It is believed that the       mortality of ARDS is at least partially the result of an over activity of the patient''s       immune system.30 Predictors of fatality from a recent retrospective, multi-center study of       150 confirmed CoViD-19 cases in Wuhan, China, included elevated ferritin (mean 1297•6 ng/ml       in non-survivors vs 614•0 ng/ml in survivors; p<0•001) and IL-6 (p<0•0001)31, suggesting that       mortality and respiratory decompensation may be due to virally-driven hyperinflammation.       Therapies that could block the cytokine storm may help improve survival and decrease the need       for ventilator use and prolonged respiratory support. Other companies are in fact developing       pharmaceutical approaches for the treatment of cytokine storm, or plasma infusions from those       who have recovered from the virus. At this point there is no cure or vaccine for the virus       and neither is there a treatment approach to dampen the systemic inflammation.       Given the CE mark and excellent safety profile, including the twenty year history of the use       of VNS to block the over production of pro-inflammatory mediators via the CAP (cholinergic       anti-inflammatory pathway), and the lack of other effective or reasonable options during this       pandemic the investigators propose deploying gammaCore® (nVNS) devices for prophylactic use       to those who have been diagnosed as infected with the virus, but before the cytokine storm       begins to cause and/or exacerbate the severe respiratory distress syndrome. The hypothesis is       that the administration of non-invasive VNS using gammaCore®, during and following severe       infection with CoViD-19 may prevent the worsening inflammatory response and acute injury       associated, thus decreasing ventilator dependence and mortality of the virus. If utilized       early enough in the course of disease the investigators hope to reduce ventilator dependence       and improve survival with a scientifically driven safe and cost-effective approach.       Furthermore, through additional acute utility of gammaCore® (nVNS) in cases of ARDS and       cytokine storm the investigators can effectively blunt the pro inflammatory response, reduce       mortality and liberate patients from mechanical ventilation earlier which will assist in       deploying the ventilator to other patients in need during the CoViD-19 pandemic.       electroCore has designed a non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) device called       gammaCore®. The gammaCore® (nVNS) device is a handheld, battery-powered unit that produces a       proprietary electrical waveform in the vicinity of the vagus nerve in the neck. Each       treatment, or dose, is relatively brief (120 seconds) and the user maintains control over the       stimulation intensity.       gammaCore® is currently commercially available for the treatment of cluster and migraine       headaches, and broad safety data with thousands of patients treated in the US Europe and the       UK in both clinical trials and routine clinical care.       Treatment paradigms have been developed and tested in clinical trials to support FDA       clearance for the acute treatment of pain associated with episodic cluster and migraine       headaches, and the prevention of cluster and migraine headache. This experience demonstrates       that nVNS may be administered safely in up to 24 two-minute doses per day. The investigators       thus have data to draw on as to how to effectively stimulate the vagus nerve. Given the       multiple modes of action with blocking the CAP, and acute bronchodilatation, using a similar       treatment paradigm for a trial to evaluate nVNS treatment of ARDS is reasonable. The device       should be used both prophylactically and acutely early in the course of the disease prior to       mechanical ventilation, and once trained, treatment can be fully managed by either a       healthcare professional or the patient. If one waits until mechanical ventilation has       started, it is less likely that a therapy will be able to block the cytokine storm and       outcomes will be less profound.       With respect to the theoretical cardiac and respiratory side effects of non-invasive       treatment, historically, stimulation of the vagus nerve is associated with adverse side       effects, including bradycardia and bronchoconstriction. These effects were shown to be the       result of in discriminant stimulation of all fibers in the vagal bundle (the vagus nerve is       primarily comprised of A and C fibers), which could be avoided by specifically tuning the       electrical signals to selectively stimulate only the A fibers. This is possible because of       the difference in electric field strengths necessary to activate the different fiber types.       The intensity, pulse duration and frequency of gammaCore® (nVNS) stimulation parameters have       been optimized to induce signals in the large, myelinated Aβ fibers of the cervical branch of       the vagus nerve. Since gammaCore® activates only the low threshold afferent Aβ fibers, versus       the high threshold efferent C-fibers that innervate the heart, there is no known risk for       adverse cardiac or other systemic parasympathetic effects.       electroCore has conducted pre-clinical studies to assess the potential risk of vagus nerve       over-stimulation on the heart and airways. Several studies were conducted in beagle dogs with       hypersensitized airways (worst case for airway reactivity) at maximum stimulation output for       2 minutes. Review of heart rate and airway resistance before, during and after stimulation       indicated that there were no significant adverse changes associated with stimulation. These       results are consistent with the human clinical experience with the gammaCore® device.       Regarding the theorized mechanism of action, afferent fibers from the vagus nerve enter the       brain and synapse onto the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in the brain stem , making       connections with many structures in the brain including the locus coeruleus (LC), the       periaqueductal gray (PAG) and the raphe nucleus (RN). These structures are known to control       the release of key inhibitory neurotransmitters. Numerous animal and clinical studies over       the last 25 years have implicated the activity of these structures, in particular the LC, in       the mechanism of action of VNS to inhibit seizures.       Clinical Use for Clinical Care - Given the lack of other effective and/or reasonable options       for a patient with CoViD-19 respiratory distress and the anticipated demands on our       healthcare system, considering gammaCore® (nVNS) therapy, the investigators propose, is a       reasonable approach. To achieve goal of decreasing health care burden with patient benefit of       decreasing ventilator dependency, inflammatory response and mortality, plan to use it early       in course of disease i.e. prior to severe respiratory distress and the need for mechanical       ventilation.       The presumptive mechanisms of bronchodilatation and modulation of the cytokine storm would       suggest that early intervention is ideal in improving pulmonary function and avoiding       respiratory depression.         1. Prevention. Mitigation of pro-inflammatory immunokine release would be best achieved            with two doses, consisting of a two-minute stimulation, on each side of the neck three            times a day (am, afternoon and an hour before bed). This would be a total of 6            treatments (2 stimulations x 3 times per day) of stimulation as a            prophylactic/preventive measure. This dosage is well below the known safety dosage            threshold         2. In addition, patients may receive additional treatments when experiencing acute            respiratory distress. Similarly, one treatment is two doses. Each treatment (a            two-minute stimulation on each side of the neck) is performed on the neck. If shortness            of breath (SOB) persists 20 minutes after start of first treatment, administer a second            treatment. Maximum number of treatments per day is 9. This is symptomatic control and            can be used to improve FEV1, Work of Breathing or dyspnea.     ","       The study is a prospective, randomized, controlled investigation designed for comparison of       two groups for the reduction of respiratory distress in a CoViD-19 population, using       gammaCore Sapphire (nVNS) plus standard of care (active) vs. standard of care alone (SoC),       the control group. The gammaCore® (nVNS) treatments will be used acutely and       prophylactically. The active and control groups will be diseased and severity matched.       The primary objective is to reduce initiation of mechanical ventilation in patients with       CoViD-19 compared to the control group. Secondary objectives are to evaluate cytokine       trends/prevent cytokine storms, evaluate supplemental oxygen requirements, decrease mortality       of CoViD-19 patients and to delay the onset of mechanical ventilation.

NCT04373135,2020-05-08,Recruiting,N/A,Interventional,"Understanding Community Considerations, Opinions, Values, Impacts, and Decisions for COVID-19",A Study to Evaluate Health Behavior and Access Impacts Due to COVID-19 and for Community Engagement of Stakeholders Surrounding Scarce Resource Allocation Policy.,Attitude of Health Personnel|Attitude to Health|Covid-19|Critical Illness|Health Behavior|Health Care Utilization,Brief educational video,All,18,,Accepts Healthy Volunteers,90095,Health Services Research,Randomized,Parallel Assignment,,None (Open Label),"       Background:       COVID-19 has led to significant disruptions to usual operations of the health care system and       routines of millions of people. Regular medical appointments have been preempted or converted       to telemedicine, dietary changes have occurred due to food supply chain strain, and exercise       regimens altered by physical distancing policies, all of which may affect preventive care and       chronic illness management. Additionally, anxiety about risk of developing COVID-19 and the       availability of health care resources may alter care-seeking behaviors even for serious       conditions, e.g., heart attacks.       Understanding personal health and protective behaviors under threat of COVID-19 is an       epidemiologic imperative and can inform immediate public health response as well as planning       for population health needs post-crisis.       Critical care capacity during COVID-19 is also a matter of extreme concern. Limitations in       capacity, particularly mechanical ventilators have necessitated scarce resource allocation       (SRA) policies, which outline triage protocols while observing ethical principles of       distributive justice, transparency, and equitability.       In practice, these policies determine which patients are most likely to benefit from       intensive care, and some patients with a significantly heightened risk for mortality are less       likely to be prioritized in critical care allocation decisions. The uncertainty around       prioritization and threat of rationing of care has generated public attention and anxiety       evident in medical journals, news outlets, and on social media.       The rapidity of this crisis has compelled rapid development and/or modification of SRA       policies without the rigorous stakeholder engagement or evaluations of acceptance of these       policies by both laypersons and practitioners tasked with implementing such policies. Two       states (CA & NY), among the most affected by COVID-19, have recently developed new SRA       policies, creating a unique opportunity to evaluate how these policies are understood and       perceived by the patients most likely to be impacted by them and the practitioners who will       implement them. Moreover, given the complexity of the ethical underpinnings and potential       misinformation about SRA policies, there is a clear need to determine if a brief educational       intervention can influence perception and knowledge about these containment and management       policies.       The investigators propose to undertake rapid recruitment of a national cohort of individuals       and health care workers to understand knowledge and perceptions of public health and clinical       efforts during this evolving pandemic; and to implement a randomized controlled trial within       this cohort to test the ability of a brief intervention to improve knowledge and perceptions       about the health care system''s capacity to provide equitable care during a pandemic. The       specific aims are to:         -  Aim 1: Determine how key indicators of population health (including health status,            health behaviors, and access to care) have changed during the COVID-19 outbreak in the            US.         -  Aim 1a: Uncover the extent of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in the impacts            of COVID-19 on health, health behaviors, and access to care.         -  Aim 2: Assess the public''s and practitioners'' knowledge and values around SRA policies            and examine which individual characteristics correlate with these knowledge and values.         -  Aim 3: Evaluate the impact of a brief educational intervention on knowledge and values            for SRA policy among the public and health care workers.       Population & Recruitment:       For Aim 1, the investigators will employ national outreach strategies via social media and       partnerships with national organizations to recruit a sample of adults (ages 18 and older)       from the general population. The investigators will enrich this sample by direct recruitment       efforts (via online health portal invitation) of over 300,000 patients in the Southern       California Area who are cared for in the University of California at Los Angeles Health       System (UCLA Health).       For Aim 2, the investigators will employ similar national outreach strategies involving       professional language targeted posts on social media sites (e.g., Doximity, LinkedIn) to       recruit a sample of health care providers. Additionally, this cohort will be enriched by       direct recruitment efforts of health workers employed by UCLA. Cohort participants in Aims 1       & 2 from California and New York (residence determined based on ZIP code) will be randomized       for Aim 3 to receive either a brief educational video or no intervention. All participants       (Aims 1-3) will be invited to complete three surveys (baseline, one-month post-intervention       follow-up, and four-month follow-up; Figure 1). Sample recruitment path and       representativeness with be assessed using unique source links and standard visitor tracking       analytics built into the study website.       Survey Assessments: Participants will first be presented with an online consent form that       includes language typical of a written consent and upon affirming consent will be directed to       complete the baseline survey. The patient baseline survey will collect sociodemographic       information (including ZIP code), chronic conditions and current health status, health       behaviors, anxiety and stress levels, changes to health and care seeking behaviors (e.g.,       social distancing, medication adherence, care-seeking behaviors), and will include series of       questions assessing perceptions and attitudes and knowledge about SRA policies and how they       are implemented (e.g., values about how decisions are made, understanding of prioritization       versus exclusion from critical care). Demographic, behavioral, and access questions are       largely derived from the validated Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System questionnaires       which will provide a historical comparison for study results. For providers, additional       questions about the characteristics of the provider will include specialty, years of       practice, and trainee status. Follow-up surveys will re-administer key baseline questions on       SRA knowledge and values, personal health behaviors, and COVID-19-specific impacts (e.g., if       they or a loved one was hospitalized and/or was subject to an SRA policy decision, and for       providers, whether they had to use an SRA tool during their practice); follow-up surveys will       additional ascertain exposure to media coverage about COVID-19 and SRAs in the intervening       windows. All surveys will be administered via Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)       system and links to complete follow-up surveys will be automatically delivered to       participants via e-mail, with up to four reminders to complete, facilitating linkage between       survey administration within individuals. E-mails will be stored separately from survey data       in REDCap and will be permanently deleted upon study completion.       Intervention and Randomization: The investigators will develop a brief (~3 min) video       intervention that describes what SRA policies are, how they were developed, who is most       likely to be impacted, and patients'' rights under these policies. Two versions will be       utilized, one oriented for a lay audience and one for practitioners using technical medical       language, but both will be relevant to the policies currently in place in two of the hardest       hit states (NY and CA). The investigators have contracted with WorldWise Productions, who       have completed similar videos for multiple other UCLA Health and DGSOM projects. The       intervention will be hosted on a private YouTube channel and embedded in REDCap so that it       can be automatically delivered as part of the survey. The investigators will execute a       stratified randomization scheme based on state, age, and education level to allocate       respondents from CA and NY evenly between intervention and control. Participants outside CA &       NY will serve as negative controls. All participants will receive a post-intervention survey       with repeat assessment (as described above).       Focus Groups:       Because COVID-19 is a rapidly evolving crisis and there are no pre-existing validated       questions to ascertain COVID-19 perceptions and impacts, the investigators plan to conduct a       final qualitative follow-up (post-crisis) with a geographically and sociodemographically       diverse selection of participants (both patients and providers) in order to obtain a more       nuanced and complete examination of perceptions, attitudes, and experiences. Participants       selected will be invited to participate approximately 4-6 months later (after the COVID-19       crisis has slowed). Key health behavior themes will include experience with telemedicine,       disruptions to health care access, and general changes to health during and after COVID-19       pandemic; particular attention will be paid to inequities in these outcomes. Key SRA themes       will include the method of selecting patients, concerns about equity, special considerations       for disadvantaged or vulnerable populations, and perceptions of the crisis response in       general. Groups will be conducted via web-conference using Zoom and recorded, transcribed,       and then qualitative methods used to analyze transcripts for key themes. The investigators       plan to conduct approximately 15 focus groups of 5-10 participants each.       Power:       To detect a ½ standard deviation change in the number of correct knowledge items between the       intervention and control arms with 90% power and a two-sided α=0.05, 172 total participants       are needed to complete follow-up. Based on prior work with >80% trial retention and       recruitment of 55 participants per day, the investigators anticipate recruiting the necessary       216 baseline trial participants within 4 days. The investigators anticipate that they will       substantially exceed the targets to achieve desired trial power.       Milestones & Actionable Outcomes:       There is a paucity of evidence on changes in health status and behaviors related to physical       distancing policies and the widescale adoption and implementation of SRA policies. By       determining how health behaviors and access to care are impacted at baseline, the       investigators can directly issue recommendations for patients and providers aimed at       affecting population health and mitigating disparities therein. The assessment of SRA       policies and how they are perceived and implemented during a crisis will dramatically       increase the ability to design and apply such policies in a fair and equitable way and to       determine what adjustments to the policies from a clinical perspective are needed to ensure       that disproportionate burden is not borne by vulnerable patients. As the baseline survey has       already been developed, piloted, and programmed into REDCap and the investigators have       established partnerships with several organizations who have already agreed to assist with       study recruitment - the investigators are prepared to initiate the study immediately.       Production on the intervention video can begin as soon as notice of funds have been received.       Trial milestones include recruitment of >216 participants from CA & NY within the first week       of recruitment and retention of >172 participants at one-month follow-up. Additional       milestones include the submission of several research papers to high-impact medical journals       detailing research findings.     ","       The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is affecting the way many people live their lives, including       seeking medical care and maintaining good self-care to keep healthy. Additionally, in the       event many people become critically ill at once, COVID-19 has the possibility of overwhelming       hospitals to the point where they have to make decisions about how to determine who receives       intensive care and life-support measures. Many hospitals as well as local or state       governments have been working on policies to determine how to make these decisions. This       study seeks to learn about how COVID-19 has affected the way patients and healthcare       providers care for themselves and about their thoughts and concerns about policies that may       ration life-support resources.

The       overarching aim of this proposal is to determine if early use of CPAP at home will reduce       hypoxemic events or reduce the need for hospital admission or death in COVID-19 suspected or       confirmed patients. The study team will include adult patients (age>18) who live alone or       have more than one bedroom at home, with serologically confirmed or suspected COVID-19       infection, who have one or more of the following: fever (>38ºC), sore throat, myalgia or       flu-like illness AND have one or more of the following additional symptom or diagnostic       criteria: abnormal chest x-ray, new onset cough, mild hypoxemia at rest (saturation less than       96%), abnormal lung exam, chest tightness or shortness of breath AND who are without need for       hospital admission. Patients with preexisting pulmonary diseases such as advanced COPD,       advanced parenchymal lung disease, history of pneumothorax etc. will be excluded.       Participants in both arms will be shipped a pulse oximeter to monitor oxygen saturation and a       disposable home sleep apnea monitor (WatchPAT) to track blood oxygen level continuously for       12 hours with data feed into a cloud based platform. Additionally, 100 patients will be       randomized to receive CPAP at fixed pressure (8-10cm H20) for 72 hours continuously (except       for daily activities such as eating, personal activities and breaks for ambulation etc). The       CPAP pressure will be adjusted based on patient''s comfort but will not deviate from the range       of 8-10cm. While the study protocol will end at 72 hours, patients who wish to continue CPAP       will be allowed to do so for symptomatic benefit up to 7 days from randomization. All CPAP       recipients will be given a full-face mask and will be asked to stay in quarantine for the       duration of the protocol to avoid risk of infecting family members with aerosol (separate       consent to be obtained from household members who are elderly or with comorbidities.) The       study team hypothesizes that early low-grade fixed CPAP in COVID infected patients who have       respiratory abnormalities will reduce hypoxemic events and decrease the risk of subsequent       hospitalization or death in 14 days from randomization. The study will also address whether       use of CPAP in the home increases the risk of infecting household family members.     ","       There is surge in COVID infected patients in New York City with a shortage of hospital beds,       ICU beds and ventilators. Strategies to reduce the need for all of the above are immediately       needed. Further, few interventions are targeted in COVID infected patients early in the       course of their disease and especially in the community/home settings. Respiratory       decompensation appears to occur later in the disease process (i.e. 7-10 days after becoming       symptomatic) therefore many patients are sent home from the Emergency Room and they       subsequently decompensate later at home. Some patients die at home and others are returning       to the Emergency Room with hypoxemic respiratory failure. There is no treatment offered to       this population of patients, i.e. COVID suspected or confirmed and with respiratory symptoms       or abnormal chest x-ray at the time of presentation.

The associated socioeconomic burden of kidney disease and AKI, as in some cases recovery is       incomplete and chronic kidney disease (CKD) can arise, is a growing problem around the world.       During the COVID 19 pandemic the incidence of AKI has been reported to be as low as 0.5% to       as high as 23%. AKI was reported to develop at a median of 15 days in one study, and another       study reported that most AKI developed within 7 days of admission. The data on acute kidney       injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19 is mostly from patients who are hospitalized, and in       some studies limited to critically ill patients in the ICU. In ICU patients the requirement       for renal support and mortality is reported to be high, however is a lack of epidemiological       studies specifically designed to determine the impact of COVID 19 on kidney outcomes.       The mortality rate of patients with kidney dysfunction varies widely and is inversely related       to country income and percentage of gross domestic product spent on total health expenditure.       Several initiatives will be very insightful and identified important gaps in knowledge, more       effort is required to understand this problem affecting all regions of the globe. In order to       eventually implement resources and tools to help prevent, diagnose and treat patients with       COVID 19 infection and kidney dysfunction, the investigators need to understand its       incidence, risk factors, available resources and barriers to diagnosis and treatment.       This project will collect data on kidney function progression in patients infected with COVID       19 across the world. The study will open to individual physicians across the world who agreed       to participate by providing de-identified clinical and lab data of patients with confirmed       COVID 19 infection with acute and chronic kidney dysfunction.       Primary Objectives:       1. Establish incidence and outcomes of acute kidney injury (AKI) in different settings       worldwide during the COVID 19 pandemic.       Secondary Objectives:         1. Compare risk factors, etiologies, diagnosis, management and outcomes of acute and            chronic kidney dysfunction in COVID 19 patients in different countries         2. Determine resources available for recognition, non-dialytic and dialytic management and            follow up of patients with acute and chronic kidney dysfunction and COVID 19 infection            in different settings and countries.         3. Determine long term outcomes, 6 months and 1 year, of patients with acute and chronic            kidney dysfunction and COVID 19 infection in different settings.         4. Evaluate barriers preventing access to the standard treatments of acute and chronic            kidney dysfunction and COVID 19 infection across different countries.         5. Determine the impact of COVID 19 infection on the progression of acute and chronic            kidney disease in patient with native and transplanted kidney.         6. Evaluate the treatment strategies of patient with ESKD on hospitalized patients with            COVID 19.     ","       The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created a significant strain on health care resources       across the world for managing critically ill patients. Emerging reports from China, South       Korea and Italy have reported varying incidence of acute kidney (AKI) ranging from 5-15% with       a mortality of 60-80% however there is no systematic assessment of the risk factors,       recognition, course and outcomes in patients with and without kidney disease whose course is       complicated by AKI1-4. Patients with underlying CKD, immunosuppressed patients with renal       transplants and ESKD patients are at high risk for COVID-19 infection and there is limited       information on the effect of COVID-19 on the course and outcomes of these patients. The       requirement for renal support including IHD, CRRT and sorbent based therapies has been       variable and has contributed to the intense pressure on the nephrology and critical care       providers for delivering these therapies. As the COVID-19 pandemic expands in the USA and       abroad, there is an intense need to understand the epidemiology of the disease and the       resources needed for renal support to inform clinical management and public health       interventions.       In this study, the investigators aim to investigate health care facilities across the world       (hospital wards, ICU, outpatient clinics, nursing homes, healthcare centers) to draw a global       picture of incidence, risk factors, resources available for treatment and prognosis of acute       and chronic kidney disease in patient with COVID 19 confirmed infection. The aim is to       identify trends in patients with acute and chronic kidney disease, determine its incidence,       treatment and outcomes in different settings across the world. This information will be used       to develop and implement educational tools and resources to prevent deaths from AKI and       progression of CKD in this and following pandemics.

Recent experience in       China suggests that convalescent immune plasma(CIP)may be an effective treatment for       COVID-19. In the pandemic situation where there are no vaccines for COVID-19, specific       antibodies in convalescent plasma induced by infection may provide passive protective       immunity. Passive antibody therapy was the first immunotherapy dating back to the 1890''s for       the treatment of infectious diseases before the development of antibiotics 1940''s. Experience       from prior outbreaks with other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-1 shows that such       convalescent plasma contains neutralizing antibodies to the relevant virus. In SARS-CoV-2,       passive antibody therapy from CIP probably provided protection by viral neutralization. CIP       was also used in the 2013 Ebola epidemic. A small non-randomized study in Sierra Leone       revealed a significant increase in survival for who received CIP4. CIP administration is the       only approach that provides immediate immunity to patients who have been exposed or who have       active disease.       This approach is immediately available from individuals who have recovered, are viral       free,and can donate immune plasma (IP) containing high titer neutralizing antibodies. Passive       antibody therapy can be given to a patient recently exposed or a patient who is developing an       infection with COVID-19 by obtaining plasma units from immune individuals by standard       plasmapheresis using FDA-approved blood banking procedures, cross matching the unit(s) to the       recipients and infusing the unit(s) using standard transfusion procedures for blood products.       Based on the safety and long-term experience with plasma infusions, plasma exchanges, and       other procedures involving plasma or plasma product, this protocol was designed as a phase II       single arm trial that involves the administration of antibodies to a given agent to a       susceptible individual for the purpose of preventing or treating an infectious disease due to       that agent.       The only antibody formulation that is available for emergent use is that found in       convalescent plasma. As more individuals contract COVID-19 and recover, the number of       potential donors will increase.       The principle of passive antibody therapy is that it is more effective when used for       prophylaxis than for treatment of disease. When used for therapy, antibody is most effective       when administered shortly after the onset of symptoms. The reason for temporal variation in       efficacy is not well understood but could reflect that passive antibody works by neutralizing       the initial inoculum, which is likely to be much smaller than that of established disease.       Alternatively, antibodies may dampen the early inflammatory response leaving the infected       individual asymptomatic. For example, antibody therapy for pneumococcal pneumonia was most       effective when given shortly after the onset of symptoms and was of no benefit if antibody       therapy was delayed beyond the third day of disease. For passive antibody therapy to be       effective, a sufficient amount of antibody must be infused. The antibody will circulate in       the blood, reach tissues,and provide protection against infection. Depending on the type of       antibody, amount, and composition, the half-life can vary from weeks to months. It is under       these circumstances, the investigators plan to treat patients who are sick enough to be       hospitalized before the onset of overwhelming disease involving a systemic inflammatory       response, sepsis, and/or ARDS.     ","       This is a single arm phase II trial to assess efficacy and confirm safety of infusions of       anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma in hospitalized patients with acute respiratory       symptoms,with or without confirmed interstitial COVID-19 pneumonia by chest Xray or CT. A       total of 29 eligible subjects will be enrolled to receive anti-SARS-CoV-2 plasma.Outcomes       will be compared to hospitalized controls with confirmed COVID-19 disease through       retrospective chart review.

Nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs will be collected for Reverse            Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing.         6. A study investigator will ask the patient''s primary team if they are planning on            treating the patient with Remdesivir. If the patient qualifies for this medication, the            study investigator will monitor the patient''s chart and work with the patient''s nurse to            ensure that the first convalescent plasma infusion and first dose of Remdesivir are            given within 24 hours of each other.       Study Design and Procedures - Transfusion Visits (Study days 0 and 1) Note - the first       transfusion visit may be done on the same day as the screening visit if time permits,       otherwise it will be done the following day. Items 1 and 2 will only be performed for the       first transfusion visit if the visit occurs the day after the screening visit.         1. The patient''s clinical status, oxygen requirement, vital signs, and physical exam will            be extracted from their clinical chart. Extracted information will include:              1. imaging: chest X-ray or chest CT results              2. labs: CBC with differential, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase                 (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, creatinine.              3. Demographic and medical information: history of present infection (length of                 symptoms prior to presentation, etc.)         2. Participants will be asked a symptom questionnaire.         3. Randomization to convalescent plasma or fresh frozen plasma will be 1:1. Randomization            will be conducted by a physician not involved in the study and using pre-prepared lists            with random permuted blocks of varying sizes. This physician will hand-deliver an order            sheet for either convalescent or fresh frozen plasma to the blood bank (this way no            orders that could potentially unblind study personnel will be in participants'' charts).         4. The blood bank technical staff will select either two compatible blood-type            non-therapeutic units of plasma or two compatible units of convalescent plasma,            depending on which group the patient has been randomized to.         5. If the blood bank does not have any product of that patient''s blood type, investigators            will not be able to have the subject complete the remainder of the study. However, the            investigators will keep the information about the participant''s blood type in the study            database. Then, in the event that plasma of the appropriate blood type is obtained,            study investigators may contact participants to find out if they are still interested in            being part of the study.         6. The blood product will be delivered to the floor and the participant''s nurse will infuse            and document plasma administration following UIC Hospital policy TX 5.03. Study            subjects will receive 1 unit of plasma the first day, with the second unit being given            the next day.         7. Once the blood product has been hung, the patient''s nurse will place it in a bag that            will prevent the patient or physician''s taking care of the patient from seeing whether            the unit is regular frozen plasma or convalescent plasma. The nurse will be under            instructions not to convey information about which type of plasma was used to the study            team.         8. The nurse will be instructed to stop the transfusion while a small sample of plasma            remains in the bag. The bag will then be sent back to the blood bank (this is usual            protocol for blood products), and remaining plasma will be emptied into a storage            container, labeled with the patient''s study identification number, and frozen for later            use for research purposes.         9. If a transfusion reaction occurs the transfusion will be stopped and reported to the            blood bank as stated in UIC Hospital policy TX 5.03.       Study Design and Procedures - Post-infusion monitoring         1. Post-transfusion clinical data will be collected from electronic medical record daily            for days 2-8 following the first transfusion (or until the participant is discharged if            they are discharged prior to 8 days following transfusion). This information includes:              1. vital signs: temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse              2. symptoms: cough, dyspnea, shortness of breath              3. oxygenation: oxygen saturation, supplemental oxygen requirement, supplemental                 oxygen method (e.g., ventilator, nasal canula, prone positioning, etc.)              4. imaging: chest X-ray or chest CT results              5. labs: CBC with differential, CRP, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, creatinine (and                 whether or not the patient has required renal support)              6. medications: antibiotics and anti-viral medications, neuromuscular blocking agents,                 vasopressors              7. location: intensive care unit, discharged, regular hospital bed         2. The participant will have a swab sample for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR collected daily for days            2-8 following the first transfusion (or as many days as they are admitted if they are            discharged prior to 8 days following the first transfusion) and on day 14 following            plasma infusion.            Participants will also have blood drawn on days 2, 4, and 8 following the first plasma            infusion for measurement of antibody titers to SARS-CoV-2 (if they are discharged prior            to day 4 or 8 they will not undergo that day''s blood draw).         3. If the patient is discharged prior to 14-days following infusion of plasma, they will be            asked to return to Project Wish on day 14 post- infusion of plasma for a blood draw (for            antibody titers), a nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swab (for RT-PCR testing) and to            answer a short symptom questionnaire.         4. The patient will be contacted by telephone (if discharged) at 28-days following plasma            infusion and will be asked a symptom questionnaire. If they remain in the hospital at            this time point, they will be asked this questionnaire (if capable) and will have            information regarding their clinical condition extracted from their chart.     ","       Patients who are ill with COVID-19 may benefit from receiving convalescent plasma infusions       containing antibodies from donors who have recovered from the disease and are proven to no       longer be infected. Given the current public health emergency due to COVID-19, the FDA has       recently fast-tracked the use of convalescent plasma. The purpose for this study is to assess       if convalescent plasma collected from donors previously infected with Severe Acute       Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, can provide       clinical benefit to those acutely ill with the virus and to evaluate if such treatment is       safe.       There will be two arms in the interventional study, where subjects will either be treated       with convalescent plasma or fresh frozen plasma in a randomized and blinded manner.

Background Passive antibody therapy involves the administration of antibodies to a given       agent to a susceptible individual for the purpose of preventing or treating an infectious       disease due to that agent. In contrast, active vaccination requires the induction of an       immune response that takes time to develop and varies depending on the vaccine recipient.       Some immunocompromised patients fail to achieve an adequate immune response. Thus, passive       antibody administration is the only means of providing immediate immunity to susceptible       persons and immunity of any measurable kind for highly immunocompromised patients.       Passive antibody therapy has a storied history going back to the 1890s and was the only means       of treating certain infectious diseases prior to the development of antimicrobial therapy in       the 1940s (1,2). Experience from prior outbreaks with other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-1       shows that such convalescent plasma contains neutralizing antibodies to the relevant virus       (3). In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the anticipated mechanism of action by which passive antibody       therapy would mediate protection is viral neutralization. However, other mechanisms may be       possible, such as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis. Convalescent       serum was also used in the 2013 African Ebola epidemic. A small non-randomized study in       Sierra Leone revealed a significant increase in survival for those treated with convalescent       whole blood relative to those who received standard treatment (4).       The only antibody type that is currently available for immediate use is that found in human       convalescent plasma. As more individuals contract COVID-19 and recover, the number of       potential donors will continue to increase.       A general principle of passive antibody therapy is that it is more effective when used for       prophylaxis than for treatment of disease. When used for therapy, antibody is most effective       when administered shortly after the onset of symptoms. The reason for temporal variation in       efficacy is not well understood but could reflect that passive antibody works by neutralizing       the initial inoculum, which is likely to be much smaller than that of established disease.       Another explanation is that antibody works by modifying the inflammatory response, which is       also easier during the initial immune response, which may be asymptomatic (5). As an example,       passive antibody therapy for pneumococcal pneumonia was most effective when administered       shortly after the onset of symptoms and there was no benefit if antibody administration was       delayed past the third day of disease (6). In this context, we seek to treat patients who are       sick enough to warrant hospitalization but prior to the onset of overwhelming disease       including advanced systemic inflammatory response, sepsis, and/or ARDS. We hypothesize that       convalescent plasma will be more effective given earlier in the hospital course and we aim to       maximize the overall potential population benefit by directing the plasma to patients who at       presentation are predicted to be at high risk but before they are in advanced overwhelming       disease. We aim to start plasma therapy within 24 hours of admission or when high risk       features are first evident.       For passive antibody therapy to be effective, a sufficient amount of antibody must be       administered. When given to a susceptible person, this antibody will circulate in the blood,       reach tissues and provide protection against infection. Depending on the antibody amount and       composition, the protection conferred by the transferred immunoglobulin can last from weeks       to months.       In the 21st century, there were two other epidemics with coronaviruses that were associated       with high mortality, SARS1 in 2003 and MERS in 2012. In both outbreaks, the high mortality       and absence of effective therapies led to the use of convalescent plasma. The largest study       involved the treatment of 80 patients in Hong Kong with SARS (7). Patients treated before day       14 had improved prognosis defined by discharge from hospital before day 22, consistent with       the notion that earlier administration is more likely to be effective. In addition, those who       were RT-PCR positive and seronegative for coronavirus at the time of therapy had improved       prognosis. There is also some anecdotal information on the use of convalescent plasma in       seriously ill individuals. Three patients with SARS in Taiwan were treated with 500 ml of       convalescent plasma, resulting in a reduction in plasma virus titer and each survived (8).       Three patients with MERS in South Korea were treated with convalescent plasma, but only two       of the recipients had neutralizing antibody in their plasma (9). The latter study highlights       a challenge in using convalescent plasma, namely, that some who recover from viral disease       may not have high titers of neutralizing antibody (10). Consistent with this point, an       analysis of 99 samples of convalescent sera from patients with MERS showed that 87 had       neutralizing antibody with a geometric mean titer of 1:61. This suggests that antibody       declines with time and/or that few patients make high titer responses.       It is also possible that other types of non-neutralizing antibodies are made that contribute       to protection and recovery as described for other viral diseases (11). There are reports that       convalescent plasma was used for therapy of patients with COVID-19 in China during the       current outbreak (http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/28/c_138828177.htm). Although few       details are available from the Chinese experience and published studies involved small       numbers of patients, the available information suggests that convalescent plasma       administration reduces viral load and was safe.

Emerging data       indicate that serum levels of IL-6 are elevated in COVID-19 patients and are predictive of       respiratory failure and mortality. IL-6 has been shown to contribute to lung damage during       SARS-CoV infection and the virus itself is capable of directly inducing its expression.       Suppression of pro-inflammatory IL-6 have been shown to have a therapeutic effect in many       inflammatory diseases, including viral infections.       In a mouse model of lung injury employing bleomycin, BLD-2660, at therapeutic doses of 30 and       100 mg/kg twice per day (BID), reduced IL-6 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid.       BLD-2660 also attenuated fibrosis damage as measured by significant reductions in the alpha       smooth muscle actin and collagen 1 in lung tissue. BLD-2660 also demonstrated target       engagement by inhibiting cleavage of one of its substrates, spectrin, in bronchoalveolar       cells.       BLD-2660 was also evaluated in a mouse model of NASH fibrosis, demonstrating an anti-fibrotic       effect. A significant decrease in IL-6 transcription was also observed. This suggests that       the effect of BLD-2660 on IL-6 is independent of the injury, or the affected organ.       It has been shown that the receptor for SARS-CoV-1 and -2 entry into the cell is       angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). ACE-2 and the dimeric calpains (data on file) are       co-expressed in respiratory epithelial cells, the site of both viral entry and predominant       early lung injury in COVID-19. Inhibition of dimeric calpain activity has not been associated       with impairment of normal immune function. The safety and tolerability of BLD-2660 has been       demonstrated in the recently completed Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD)/multiple ascending       dose (MAD) B-2660-101 study.       As BLD-2660 has been demonstrated to (1) reduce tissue IL-6 levels and (2) attenuate lung       fibrosis damage, it could therefore, potentially reduce the nonproductive IL-6 mediated       host-response to infection, which contribute to morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. In       addition, data suggest that survivors of SARS-CoV-2 infection are at risk for chronic       impairment of pulmonary function, likely attributable to pulmonary fibrosis secondary to lung       injury and inflammation. Although there is not yet available data documenting numbers of       patients infected with SARS CoV2 pneumonia who progress to pulmonary fibrosis, epidemiology,       viral immunology, and current clinical evidence support that pulmonary fibrosis may become       one of the serious long-term complications of survivors of COVID-19 related pneumonia.       Thus, BLD-2660 could not only potentially downregulate the nonproductive host-response to       infection, which contributes to morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 but also could reduce       potential long-term fibrosis and loss of pulmonary function resulting from SARS-CoV       pneumonia. This study will evaluate BLD-2660 as an add-on therapy to standard of care (SOC)       in hospitalized subjects with recent diagnosis of COVID-19.

However, the optimal antithrombotic regimen for patients with COVID-19,       especially those with severe disease, remains uncertain and is currently an area of active       clinical interest. Prophylactic-dose anticoagulation is generally recommended for acutely ill       hospitalized patients. However, given the hemostatic abnormalities of severe COVID-19       illness, it is unknown whether more intensive anticoagulation is preferred to reduce the risk       of thrombotic events, potentially mitigating microvascular and macrovascular thrombi and even       disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Further, the risks of therapeutic dose       anticoagulation must be weighed against the bleeding risks inherent to this approach.

Over the following       months, it quickly spread across the continent and, in short order, the globe, making an       impact that hasn''t been seen in generations. Although coronaviruses have been prevalent for       millennia, this version is immunologically novel, and thus there is no natural immunity to       the virus. This has been a major reason for its rapid spread across the world.       Previous members of the coronavirus family have typically caused upper respiratory symptoms       such as the common cold, though there have also been more virulent versions of this virus       seen in the recent past, such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle       East Respiratory Syndrome). Similarly named, SARS-CoV-2 also causes upper respiratory       symptoms but has varied from the previous viral syndromes in a number of ways including how       quickly it has been able to transmit within a population. This is a disease that does not       segregate and can affect all ages, genders, and ethnicities. Everyone is susceptible to this       virus.       New diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for respiratory viruses are also being rapidly       developed and polymerase chain reaction-based (PCR) diagnostics and multiplex assays are       increasingly used in clinical laboratories for SARS-CoV-2 clinical detection and subtyping.       Rapid antigenic and genetic evolution has been expected for SARS-CoV-2 strains, and a better       understanding of SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary dynamics is needed to establish an effective       vaccine.       Our present understanding of the nature and extent of the upper respiratory track (URT)       microbiome in humans is limited. Furthermore, we have little understanding of how acute viral       respiratory infections of SARS-CoV-2 influence the URT microbiome, or how genotypic       differences in the virus influence the URT microbiome and vice versa. Innate immune responses       to pathogens, along with dysregulation of inflammation, are key factors involved in       pathogenesis, and different viral pathogens activate different types of inflammatory       responses. Respiratory viral infection i.e., SARS-CoV-2 infection is expected to activate       TLR2, TLR3, TLR4 and TLR7 responses and this is likely to modulate commensal microbiota       populations. It is not yet known if the severity of SARS-CoV-2 disease in older adults is due       to a biased host response, SARS-CoV-2 virulence determinants, or the impact infection has on       commensal microbiota.       Up to this point, there is no unanimously approved treatment for the disease nor is there a       vaccine or antiviral drugs available for the public. The primary methods for treatment of       this deadly virus have been supportive in nature including intubation in severe cases with       respiratory failure.       While a unanimous treatment has yet to be discovered, there has been a great amount of       knowledge garnered over the last few months about the virus and the disease that accompanies       it. Several studies have demonstrated high viral titers within the nasopharynx and oral       cavity and many have posited that this is the primary source of infection and viral       replication. Additionally, a high nasal/nasopharyngeal viral load has been associated with       increased symptoms and higher severity of the disease.       Interestingly, there have been a number of studies recently looking at the effect of nasal       saline irrigations in the setting of viral URIs, including coronaviruses (not including       SARS-CoV-2). One of the major takeaways from these studies was decreased viral shedding in       patients treated with saline irrigations compared to the control group. Nasal saline       irrigations are available over the counter and widely viewed as both safe and affordable.       Could these irrigations have a similar effect on the novel SARS-CoV-2 that they have on other       viral respiratory infections?     ","       Nasal saline irrigations are a safe and commonly used mechanism to treat a variety of       sinonasal diseases including sinusitis, rhinitis, and upper respiratory tract infections.       When used properly, these irrigations are a safe and easy intervention available over the       counter without a prescription. Additionally, baby shampoo has been found to be a safe       additive functioning as a surfactant when a small amount is added to the saline rinses which       may help augment clearance of the sinonasal cavity.       While many systemic medications and treatments have been proposed for COVID-19, there has not       yet been a study looking at targeted local intervention to the nasal cavity and nasopharynx       where the viral load is the highest. Studies have shown that the use of simple over the       counter nasal saline irrigations can decrease viral shedding in the setting of viral URIs,       including the common coronavirus (not SARS-CoV-2). Further, as SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped       virus, mild-detergent application with nasal saline would neutralize the virus further. It is       our hypothesis that nasal saline or nasal saline with baby shampoo irrigations may decrease       viral shedding/viral load and viral transmission, secondary bacterial load, nasopharyngeal       inflammation in patients infected with the novel SARS-CoV-2.     ","Viral RNA will be extracted using a standard Qiagen viral RNA isolation kit.

The first case of this unprecedented outbreak pneumonia of unknown etiology       was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China on December 8th, 2019 and reported to the       World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31st, 2019. WHO declared a COVID-19 global       emergency on January 30, 2020, and then categorized the outbreak as a pandemic on March 11,       2020. As of April 22, 2020, more than 2,628,894 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide and       182,740 people globally have died from COVID-19 since it emerged in China, according to the       data from Johns Hopkins University.       While the majority of patients with COVID-19 develop mild or uncomplicated illness,       approximately 20-30% of hospitalized patients have required intensive care support and 5% of       those have multi-organ failure or shock. The case fatality rate ranges from 1 to 4% and it is       higher among those with pre-existing comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease,       diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension and cancer. The vast       majority of patients present with fever (83-99%), cough (59-82%), fatigue (44-70%), anorexia       (40-84%), shortness of breath (31-40%), sputum production (28-33%), myalgias (11-35%).

Anosmia or ageusia proceeding the onset of respiratory       symptoms has been anecdotally reported.       To date, treatments for COVID-19 in high risks individuals remain experimental and       therapeutic strategies to deal with the infection are at best supportive, with prevention       aimed at reducing transmission in the community as the best weapon. No proven therapies have       been demonstrated to prevent the progression of COVID-19 to severe illness and this is a       critical unmet need for high-risk individuals and warrants study. Recently, the Infectious       Disease Society of America has made recommendations for the treatment of patients with       COVID-19, focusing on inpatient care, and recommending randomized trials where possible as       the best step to improve treatment outcomes and to increase our understanding of this       coronavirus pandemic. Discoveries in this area may inform clinicians on effective treatment       for low-risk individuals who progress to severe illness, as well.

In order to assist during this exceptionally challenging       crisis, this research team has developed a brief daily intervention based on decades of       stress and trauma research that may help to support psychological health and coping resources       in individuals on the frontlines: medical personnel and first-responders. These are       individuals who are most essential to society in this difficult time. Although hospitals,       fire, and police departments have existing support resources in place, they are either based       on traditional models of treatment or consist of online peer-support or wellness       applications. All facets of existing support/interventions have considerable utility, but it       is not clear that these resources are designed to address the frequent and ongoing coping       demands of this crisis across a broad swath of individuals. In particular, traditional       psychotherapy models are unlikely to be successful due to very real time constraints of this       population at this time. Moreover, several decades of research would argue that traditional       psychotherapy is unlikely to be needed by most individuals, given prototypical patterns of       adjustment across a range of aversive events, including prior pandemics (SARS: Bonanno, et al       2008). However, even resilient individuals will struggle with distress and some symptoms.       Prior research has suggested that specific emotion processing patterns can support resilient       outcomes over the long-term and thus frontline workers may benefit from an intervention that       leverages this existing knowledge to facilitate adaptive emotion regulatory processing and       elevate well-being during this crisis.       The proposed project aims to investigate a novel intervention: A Daily Coping Toolkit,       administered via online application, that consists of 3 activities targeting adaptive       emotional attention and expression, administered one time each day, only 4-10 minutes in       duration daily. The Toolkit is both practically feasible given the demands and current burden       on the target population as well as highly consistent with existing evidence. Moreover, the       Toolkit is not likely to conflict with other online tools or with traditional psychotherapy       and hence, can be practically applied across a broad swath of individuals in need. The       primary project aim is to test the Daily Coping Toolkit on a broader population of medical       personnel and first responders to determine efficacy over time, to test relative dosing, and       to explicate the underlying therapeutic processes. The potential impact of this research will       be evidence to support the further use of this novel tool to assist essential front-line       personnel during this ongoing crisis. This may assist with mitigating the psychological toll       of this crisis and also support the occupational functioning of medical personnel and first       responders, thus, contributing indirectly to improved patient outcomes. Finally, knowledge       gained from this research will support the further development of this tool to support       individuals facing future challenging events and circumstances.       Participants: n=1000 medical personnel and first responders to test the efficacy of the Daily       Coping Toolkit.       Procedure: Interested individuals will go to www.tinyurl.com/dailycopingtoolkit for       additional information, including the informed consent. Once consent is provided, individuals       complete a brief assessment of current symptoms, well-being and psychiatric/treatment history       and then receive instructions to download the research application ExpiWell       (www.expiwell.com) a secure platform that operates on ios/Android devices upon which we       administer the Toolkit. Once downloaded, participants are randomized to a high versus low       treatment condition and will receive daily prompts to complete the intervention. After 7       days, they complete a brief assessment of symptoms, well-being, and acceptability of the       intervention and consent again for continuation in the research. Individuals can continue to       use the application without consenting further if they choose and their data will not be       accessible to researchers. For those that do consent, follow-up assessments occur at 2,6, and       9 months (symptoms and well-being).       Daily Coping Toolkit Intervention: Participants are prompted one time daily (with 1-2       reminders) to complete the intervention which consists of the following three parts.       Randomization to high versus low condition is maintained for the first 7 days only in order       to test for relative dose effects (see #3 below).         1. Emotion Labelling Activity: Participants rate 10 discrete negative and positive            emotional words on a likert scale (0-4). Precise labelling of emotional experience can            serve as a form of implicit emotion regulation and has been associated with healthy            psychophysiological and behavioral adaptation in a range of community and clinical            samples         2. Expressive Writing and Self Distancing Activity: Participants respond to an open-ended            prompt to write about their day in an open text box in response to the prompt: What was            today like...? After this is completed, they are prompted that if the experience was            very challenging, to revisit that experience in their mind by taking a fly on the wall            perspective (Kross & Ayduk, 2016; see figure for instructions). Persistent evidence has            indicated that expressive writing is an effective coping tool. In addition, research has            identified the ways in which specific word use can facilitate healthy emotional            processing during stress. There is also significant research demonstrating that shifting            perspective about negative emotional experiences can facilitate a healthier distance            from it.         3. Positive Emotion Generation Activity (1 v. 2 prompts) Participants are prompted to take            a deep breath and then respond to 1 (or 2) of 8 possible prompts in which they can            generate positive emotions. In response to each, they are asked to describe their            thoughts or memories in open-ended text box. Note: For the first 7 days, participants            are randomized to either respond to one (low dose) or two (high dose) prompts so as to            test the relative efficacy of the dose. After 8 days, all participants default to the            higher dose of 2 prompts. Prompts are designed to elicit gratitude, positive social            experiences, amusing memories, kind acts they committed, satisfaction/pride with            accomplishments, positive future focus, and love for close others. Prior research has            demonstrated that positive emotions generated during highly stressful events predict            resilience and improved emotion regulation and coping. Moreover, positive emotion            generation has been shown broadly to predict increased psychological wellbeing.     ","       During the current COVID-19 Pandemic, all communities are relying heavily on medical       personnel and first-responders to maintain high levels of psychological and occupational       functioning. However, during times of persistent high levels of stress, many individuals       experience depletion in psychological resources, suffering intense distress that can make       daily occupational and interpersonal functioning difficult. In order to assist with this       immense challenge, this research team has developed a brief daily intervention based on       decades of stress and trauma research that may help to support psychological health in       individuals on the frontlines who are most essential to society. Considerable evidence       supports the role of attention to and conceptualization of emotional experience in       psychological resilience. This project tests a highly innovative combination of interventions       targeting these processes in a brief, daily activity. The primary project aim is to       investigate the Daily Coping Toolkit for medical personnel and first responders to determine       efficacy over time, to test relative dosing, and to explicate the underlying therapeutic       processes. The toolkit consists of 3 activities, administered one time each day, taking       minutes to complete and will be administered to n=1000 personnel. Data analysis will test the       impact of the toolkit on momentary affective processes and on symptoms and wellbeing over 9       months. The impact of this research will be evidence to support the further use of this novel       tool to assist essential front-line personnel during this ongoing crisis helping to mitigate       the psychological toll and also support occupational functioning now and in the future.

Randomization will be stratified by clinical center and by moderate versus severe       ARDS. The study is designed to have three interim analyses for stopping accrual early for       efficacy and futility when 30%, 45% and 60% of the 300 patients have reached the primary       endpoint using Bayesian predictive probabilities.       Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation to intravenous infusion of MSCs       (remestemcel-L) plus standard of care versus placebo plus standard of care for the treatment       of COVID-19 related ARDS:         -  Group 1: 2x10^6 MSC/kg of body weight plus standard of care, administered twice during            the first week, with the second infusion at 4 days following the first infusion (± 1            day)         -  Group 2: Placebo (Plasma-Lyte) plus standard of care, administered twice during the            first week, with the second infusion at 4 days following the first infusion (± 1 day)            (control)       MSCs and placebo will initially be administered intravenously in the dose defined above at       randomization. The rate of infusion may be tailored to the patient''s respiratory status and       fluid status, but the duration of infusion should not exceed 60 minutes.       Patients will be followed for 90 days post randomization, with assessment of pulmonary       symptoms at 6 and 12 months.     ","       The mortality rate in SARS-CoV-2-related severe ARDS is high despite treatment with       antivirals, glucocorticoids, immunoglobulins, and ventilation. Preclinical and clinical       evidence indicate that MSCs migrate to the lung and respond to the pro-inflammatory lung       environment by releasing anti-inflammatory factors reducing the proliferation of       pro-inflammatory cytokines while modulating regulatory T cells and macrophages to promote       resolution of inflammation. Therefore, MSCs may have the potential to increase survival in       management of COVID-19 induced ARDS.       The primary objective of this phase 3 trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the       addition of the mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) remestemcel-L plus standard of care compared       to placebo plus standard of care in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)       due to SARS-CoV-2.

HT-CCP is plasma that contains a high amount of antibodies that were       made to fight off COVID-19 because it is donated by another person who has also been infected       with coronavirus but has recovered, so their immune system has had enough time to make these       antibodies. This study is being done to determine whether HT-CCP will help people with       COVID-19 recover from their infection more quickly and lower their risk of having to go on a       ventilator or reduce the time they need to stay on a ventilator. It is not yet known whether       HT-CCP helps people with COVID-19, which is why the study needs to be randomized, meaning       some subjects will be randomly selected to receive HT-CCP while others will be randomly       selected to receive FFP.

In children, recent evidence highlights acute and       long-term neurological manifestations due to other viral illnesses including Guillain Barre       syndrome and neonatal microcephaly with Zika virus, encephalitis with H1N1 influenza, and       acute flaccid paralysis with enterovirus-68. However, COVID-19 reports in children published       thus far lack detailed information on the frequency and outcomes of neurological findings.       COVID-19 cases are rapidly rising internationally, with experts forecasting subsequent global       surges and continued activity. Thus, it is imperative to accurately document prevalence and       outcomes of the neurological aspects of COVID-19 specifically in children. Such data will       serve to alert clinicians and families about the possibility that children may present with       neurologic rather than classic symptoms of COVID-19 who nevertheless would warrant testing,       and that neurologic events can occur subsequent to the diagnosis that may impact long-term       outcomes (e.g., cognitive, emotional, physical health). The investigators anticipate that       improved knowledge about neurologic manifestations in children will bolster personalized       treatment and rehabilitation strategies to optimize child outcomes and inform future       interventional studies.

We need to develop a treatment       protocol which prevents progression of the disease and a treatment protocol to rescue those       with advanced disease. In addition to anti-viral therapeutics currently under investigation       in other trials, the addition of immunomodulators to the treatment regimen appears have to       potential to act as agents which can reduce the pathogenicity of this disease by reducing the       dysregulation of autoimmunity which is destructive of normal tissue and when unchecked       rapidly leads to mortality.       COVID-19 infection has three stages and 80% of infected people stay in stage 1 or stage 2A       (viral response and early pulmonary effects), however 20% of patients progress to stage 2B       (late pulmonary effects), and of those about 20% progress to stage 3 (hyper-inflammation). An       ideal treatment for COVID-19 would have a two-pronged strategy: a treatment that would slow       or interrupt the progression of the disease from mild/moderate (stage 1-2A) to severe (stage       2B-3), and a treatment to rescue patients who have become severe. Promising data using       tocilizumab, an monoclonal antibody targeting the cytokine Interleukin-6 (IL-6), suggests       that interrupting IL-6 is one of the potential pathways to accomplish this.       Low-dose naltrexone has been used off-label for treatment of pain and inflammation in       multiple sclerosis, Crohn''s disease, fibromyalgia and other pain conditions. Lower than       standard doses of naltrexone inhibit cellular proliferation of T- and B- cells and block       Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), providing pain relief and anti-inflammatory benefit. Naltrexone       at doses below the normal therapeutic dose appears to reduce production of multiple cytokines       including IL-6 in a steady pace and is available as an oral preparation. As such it is ideal       to use to attempt to modify progression to stage 2B as it can easily be given to both       hospitalized patients and patients in the community.       Ketamine at low doses, below the normal anesthetic dose, appears to rapidly reduce the       production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha       (TNFα), for hours after an event which would induce the inflammatory response. This drug is       given intravenously (IV), either by drip or push, and is easily given in a hospital       environment. This could not easily be used in the community but could act as a rescue drug       with lower cost and easier availability than tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting       IL-6. Ketamine has been extensively studied in a variety of settings and indications with a       well-established side-effect and dosing profile. Ketamine is generally well tolerated and       remains inexpensive and widely available on the U.S. market and available for immediate use.       The trial will measure the ability of low dose naltrexone to reduce the progression of       participants with COVID-19. In this study, naltrexone or placebo will be given to       participants in early stages of COVID-19 infection in a randomized, double blinded manner,       whereas the use of ketamine will be unblinded and given as a rescue agent should a       participant progress. Additionally, should a participant be ineligible for the randomized       portion of the study due to already being in a more advanced stage of the disease, they will       be given the opportunity to enter the trial to receive ketamine without being randomized to       naltrexone vs placebo.       Participants will continue to receive any standard of care COVID-19 treatment during their       participation in this study. Laboratory blood tests such as IL-6 concentration, blood counts,       liver and renal function panels as well as close physician supervision will be used to       monitor participant condition during hospitalization. Participants will be contacted 1 month       post discharge to evaluate outcomes and potential side effects.     ","       Ideal new treatments for Novel Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) would help halt the progression       disease in patients with mild disease prior to the need for artificial respiration       (ventilators), and also provide a rescue treatment for patients with severe disease, while       also being affordable and available in quantities sufficient to treat large numbers of       infected people. Low doses of Naltrexone, a drug approved for treating alcoholism and opiate       addiction, as well as Ketamine, a drug approved as an anesthetic, may be able to interrupt       the inflammation that causes the worst COVID-19 symptoms and prove an effective new       treatment. This study will investigate their effectiveness in a randomized, blinded trial       versus standard treatment plus placebo.

The most current       statistics from Iceland, China, and Italy indicate that up to 50% of infected patients may be       asymptomatic or with negligible symptomatology. This, added to the national shortage of       personal protective equipment (PPE) and the need to reuse PPE, lends to the significantly       increased risk to healthcare providers.       The highest concentration of viral particles resides within the nasopharynx. The virus is       thought to spread via respiratory droplets with the potential for transmission via inhalation       of droplets, contact to the nose and mouth with infected materials, and airborne       transmission. Given that frontline workers are involved in high-risk procedures including       intubation, bronchoscopy, proning patients (which can lead to droplet production) and in some       cases are reusing PPE, finding ways to reduce viral load or viral exposure are paramount.       Povidone-iodine (PVP-I) is a broad-spectrum antiseptic with activity against bacteria, fungi,       and viruses. It has been previously used in both intranasal preparations against MRSA as well       as oral preparations in in-vitro studies of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, H1N1, and rotavirus with good       efficacy.       Due to the known breadth of its antiviral activity and similarities in molecular structure,       it can be extrapolated that PVP-I should have robust activity against SARS-CoV-2. Eggers et       al found that at a concentration of 1% there was a reduction of viral activity of 99.99% in       in-vitro assays. At 2 minutes, a concentration of 0.23% was enough to reduce viral loads       appreciably.       PVP-I is widely used as an antiseptic and is well-tolerated and has been shown to have little       to no effect on mucociliary clearance, olfaction, or thyroid function if iodine holidays are       taken.       In this study, front line healthcare workers will be asked to complete a pre-participation       survey and screened for COVID positivity. They will then be given premade PVP-I gargles and       nasal sprays, as well as a calendar card to mark compliance. PVP-I nasal spray and gargle       (10% diluted 1:30) will be used prior to the start of a shift, during lunch break, and at       the end of shift. First, the nasal spray will be sprayed in the nose (2 sprays each naris).       For adequate coverage, the participant should be able to taste the iodine or see it in the       back of the throat. This should be left in place for 30 seconds. Then, the participant will       gargle the solution for 30 seconds and not have anything to eat or drink by mouth for 30       minutes. Treatment will continue for 3 weeks, or until the healthcare worker presents with       COVID symptoms. Participants will then be tested for COVID positivity and asked to fill out a       second questionnaire assessing study tolerability. At completion of the study, they will be       asked to turn in their calendar card to assess how many applications they were able to       complete.       Given the high rate of asymptomatic carriers, a second arm will also be planned for patients       who have a 7+ day hospitalization or who are set to undergo a significant surgical procedure.       These patients will be offered participation in the study as well and will be given the same       questionnaire and undergo preoperative testing if they consent. For patients in the study       group, PVIP gargle and nasal sprays will be applied preoperatively or shortly after admission       and enrollment in the study for the non-operative group. The patients will then be retested       in 2 weeks or as directed by the presentation of symptoms concerning for infection with       SARS-CoV-2.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a       pandemic on March 11th, 2020. The clinical disease (COVID-19) is mild in 81% of patients,       severe disease occurs in 14%, and 5% of cases result in critical illness. The reported       overall case fatality rate (CFR) is 2.3% in China, although the CFR varies widely (0.7- 7.2%)       between regions. Older age is associate with increased mortality. The reported CFR is 8%       among patients 70-79 years old and 15% in those 80 years and older.       Multiple therapies have been proposed based on in vitro evidence or anecdotal reports.       Although, no high quality clinical trials have demonstrated an effective treatment regimen       other than supportive care. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major       complication among patients with severe disease. In a report of 138 patients with COVID-19,       20% developed ARDS at a median of 8 days after the onset of symptoms, with 12.3% of patients       requiring mechanical ventilation. Efficacious therapies are desperately needed. Supportive       care combined with intermittent prone positioning may improve outcomes.       Prone positioning (PP) of patients with severe ARDS (when combined with other lung-protective       ventilation strategies) is associated with a significant mortality benefit. In addition, PP       for >12 hours in severe ARDS is strongly recommended by clinical practice guidelines.       Improvements in gas exchange, cardiac output, and clearance of secretions have been       demonstrated with PP, and are thought to contribute to the survival benefits. Low quality       evidence from case series and retrospective studies in awake, spontaneously breathing       patients suggest PP is feasible, improves oxygenation, and may avoid the need for mechanical       ventilation. A recent prospective observational study of early PP combined with high-flow       nasal cannula or non-invasive mechanical ventilation was well tolerated and may help patients       avoid intubation.       This study is a single-center non-blinded randomized controlled pragmatic feasibility study       comparing the outcomes of prone positioning (intervention) versus usual care (control) in       non-intubated patients hospitalized for COVID-19.

The rapid spread of the associated disease, COVID-19,       has overwhelmed healthcare systems in spite of unprecedented measures to reduce contagion.       The resulting uncertainty with regard to the duration and magnitude of the pandemic and       limited availability of resources and treatment have been detrimental to the mental health of       frontline healthcare providers (NIH). Preserving the psychological wellbeing of these       individuals is paramount to mitigating the effect of COVID-19 and delivering optimal patient       care.       Of particularly grave concern is how professional and personal distress caused by the       COVID-19 pandemic will affect provider burnout (Lai et al. JAMA Network Open 2020).       Professional burnout, characterized by emotional exhaustion, career de-prioritization, and       loss of self-efficacy, represents a significant threat to the US healthcare system (Shanafelt       et al. Ann Surg 2010; Han et al. Annals of Internal Medicine 2019). While burnout has been       described as a reaction to chronic work-related stress (Melamed et al. Psychol. Bull. 2006),       individual factors such as anxiety increase susceptibility to burnout (Sun et al. J Occup       Health 2012). Although data suggests that occupational stress might amplify risk of anxiety       (DiGiacomo and Adamson J Allied Health 2001), we have yet to understand how intensified       anxiety among frontline providers during global health crises contributes to burnout.       Similarly, it is unknown whether factors such as perceived organizational support (POS), a       key driver of job satisfaction and performance (Muse and Stamper, J Managerial Issues 2007),       modify anxiety and burnout under these circumstances. We hypothesize that diminished POS in       response to the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with burnout and that this relationship is       mediated by an increase in providers'' anxiety. Delineating this relationship is a critical       first step in developing interventions that ease the mental health burden of this pandemic       and future crises for healthcare providers.     ","As healthcare providers have limited time, it is unclear if this request to watch a 1 hour video on coping strategies will be a feasible intervention. We will assess how many individuals endorse actually watching this video.",Feasibility of undertaking task,"UPMC; Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania; 15218; Sara Myers, MD","Sara P Myers, MD, PhD; 412-647-0597; myerssp@upmc.edu"

This study will test and follow persons quarantined at home after testing positive for       SARS-CoV-2 (COV) and their household members.       The CO-HOST mobile nurse initiates a home visit to the home of the COVID-19 index case after       they and their household members (COV-HC) verbally express interest in the study and provide       consent or assent as appropriate. At the first visit, nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and blood are       collected from COV and all members of the household (COV-HC) to determine infection status.       Additional samples (nasal swabs, saliva, nasal strips), both nurse-collected and       self-collected, may also be collected from COV and COV-HC.

In Wuhan, China, nine women who were COVID-19       positive were surveilled for vertical transmission and overall obstetric and early neonatal       outcomes. Amniotic fluid, umbilical cord blood, and neonatal throat swabs were collected at       the time of delivery, and breastmilk samples were collected after lactation commenced. There       was no viral detection of COVID-19 demonstrated.2 However, two neonates in the United Kingdom       have tested positively for COVID-19 after delivery from an infected mother. Most recently,       antibodies were detected (IgM and IgG) in the serum of a neonate born via cesarean delivery       to a known positive mother. Therefore, vertical transmission has not been completely ruled       out.       Additionally, infection at varying times of pregnancy has not been well delineated or       correlated to neonatal or maternal outcomes at time of delivery. Therefore, there is a need       to continue surveying and documenting clinical findings in obstetric COVID-19 cases.

This trial is designed to       generate point prevalence of infected (I) persons, independent of clinical symptoms. The       susceptible (S) class is the number of COVID-19 tested by any FDA-approved NP swab test or a       SARS-CoV2 IgG antibody test. At present FDA does not have approved SARS-CoV serology and such       serology is not used for diagnosis of acute infection. The recovered (R) class is the number       of positives. This information allows for modeling of the COVID-19 epidemic in NC. The       investigation is not testing the effectiveness or safety of either of these testing       modalities, though serology may be offered in the future by UNC Healthcare laboratories. The       blood samples to be obtained assess development of host response to SARS-CoV2 infection.       ScreenNC will be implemented within the logistic and clinical limitations of the current       outbreak. This is a single visit study. Since there is a shortage of PPE the investigators       will rely on screening at locations different then the screening of presumed infected       persons. Additionally, due to logistical considerations, volunteers may have a viral swab       (nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal) and/or a blood sample obtained. Thus, at recruitment,       volunteers may be asked to give both samples or only one.       Viral load testing will be done at LabCorp and/or UNC labs using compatible assays (Roche,       ThermoFischer , WHO). Confirmatory testing (other PCR, sequencing, culture) will be done at       UNC.

The ongoing SARS CoV-2 pandemic       originated in Wuhan, Hubei, China and has spread worldwide. The disease caused by SARS CoV-2       (COVID19) is manifest by fever, fatigue, dry cough, pharyngitis and headache. Although the       majority (~80%) COVID19 cases are mild in severity, patients may present with moderate       symptoms of dyspnea, tachypnea (~15%) or more severe symptoms (~5-10%) of pneumonia, acute       respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypotension, arrythmias and shock(6-9). In addition to       the common clinical presentation of respiratory distress, an increasing frequency of       cardiovascular manifestations have become evident. These manifestations may be linked to the       Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor, a membrane-bound aminopeptidase that has       been identified as the functional receptor for SARS CoV-2, which is expressed predominantly       in the heart, intestine, kidney and pulmonary alveolar (type 2) cells. Recent data suggest       that ~20% of infected subjects may require hospitalization and among patients hospitalized       for COVID19, 12-28% will have evidence of myocardial injury (elevated high-sensitivity       Troponin: hsTPN) often in association with electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities,       arrythmias and/or evidence for impaired Left Ventricular contractile function on non-invasive       imaging. Indeed, a syndrome of pseudo-infarction manifest as ST-segment elevation in the       absence of obstructive coronary artery disease has been described. The etiology(s) of       myocardial injury may be multifactorial and includes demand ischemia due to critical illness,       cytokine storm with atherosclerotic plaque disruption due to overwhelming systemic       inflammation and more likely, myocarditis. Indeed, SARS CoV viral RNA along with macrophage       infiltration and myocardial cell injury has been detected in autopsied heart samples from       patients who succumbed to the SARS outbreak in Toronto. Further, myocardial injury has been       directly correlated with both the degree of systemic inflammation (Level of hsCRP) and       cardiac dysfunction (level of NT-proBNP). Importantly, myocardial injury was identified to be       one of the two most significant, independent predictors (by multi-variable analysis) of       hospital death (in addition to ARDS) and provides increased prognostic information above and       beyond that provided by pre-existing co-morbidities including age, diabetes mellitus,       hypertension and pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Indeed, the incremental risk for death       incurred by evidence of myocardial injury appears to be ~5-10x and is amplified by       pre-existing cardiovascular disease.       Thus, evidence of myocardial injury has evolved to be a significant (if not the most       significant) predictor of mortality among patients admitted to hospital for care of COVID19       disease. It is important to recognize that this elevated morality risk has been identified       despite modern and aggressive intensive care therapies including mechanical ventilation,       pressor/inotrope therapies and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).       In this context, the investigators propose to evaluate intravenous administration of       convalescent plasma (CP) obtained from COVID19 survivors in patients requiring       hospitalization for symptomatic high risk COVID19 disease as reflected by the presence of       elevated hsTPN. Supportive data exist for use of convalescent plasma in the treatment of       COVID19 and other overwhelming viral illness. The investigators hypothesize that treatment       with COVID19 CP will demonstrate salutary effects on COVID19 disease severity/duration, with       the primary objective to reduce mortality and a key secondary objective to reduce the       requirement for and/or duration of mechanical ventilation. Finally, as the hospital mortality       for patients requiring mechanical ventilation is very high (50 to 80%), these patients will       be eligible for COVID19 CP treatment as well, even in the absence of elevated hsTPN. Although       considerable overlap of these populations has been observed (elevated hsTPN and requirement       for mechanical ventilation) there is not 100% redundancy and it is hopeful that COVID19 CP       may provide benefit to these critically ill patients.       This is a single arm, non-randomized, open-label treatment of eligible subjects defined as       those who satisfy all inclusion criteria.       Eligible subjects will provide written, informed consent prior to participation. A pregnancy       test will be obtained on all women of child-bearing potential.

Following baseline assessments and informed consent, eligible enrollees will       receive convalescent CoVID-19 plasma by intravenous infusion.       COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Study: Convalescent plasma will be obtained from male donors,       nulliparous females, or female donors negative for HLA antibodies at least 28 days following       recovery from COVID-19 infection. These donors are used to minimize the risk of       transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). Routine ABO and Rh typing and red cell       antibody screening will be performed. All plasma will be required to test negative to the       following assays per FDA and AABB regulations/ guidelines.       COVID Convalescent Plasma 500 mls will be administered in intravenously.

Although considerable overlap of these populations has       been observed (elevated hsTPN and requirement for mechanical ventilation) there is not 100%       redundancy and it is hopeful that COVID19 CP may provide benefit to these critically ill       patients.

This risk may be related in part to the patient s            immune response which can be characterized with respect to the B- and T-cell repertoire.            Determining patterns of immune response which correlate with clinically effective            immunity may help in determining risk.         -  Patients receiving a vaccine for COVID-19 are tested for antibody production, but            ultimately protection from infection and survival are the most important endpoints,            which will take time. If patients can be checked for a pre-defined favorable pattern of            immune response, it may significantly speed selection of effective candidate vaccines.         -  In patients with hematologic malignancies, including patients with hairy cell leukemia            (HCL) who we have extensive experience treating, we do not know if we should be steering            away more from treatments which harm B-cell immunity, like rituximab or obinutuzumab, or            steering away more from treatments which harm T-cell immunity, like purine analogs.            Characterizing the immune response in COVID-19 patients will quickly answer this            question.       Objective:       - To characterize immune response in patients with current or prior COVID-19 infection       Eligibility:         -  Age 18 years or older         -  Patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection, or normal donors (i.e., those            individuals without COVID-19)       Design:         -  Blood and urine samples will be collected for research to characterize immune response.         -  In individuals with known current or prior COVID-19, samples will be obtained up to            every three days but no more than 10 times overall during the acute phase of infection            and after recovery. In individuals without COVID-19 at the time of enrollment (i.e.,            normal donors), samples will be collected once; in the case of future COVID-19            infection, samples may be collected at the same times during/post-infection as an            individual with COVID-19 at enrollment.         -  All subjects will be followed for approximately 2 years. An additional blood sample may            be collected in all subjects at one additional time after the receipt of future            COVID-19- related vaccination.         -  This protocol does not involve treatment. The accrual ceiling is set at 150 subjects.     ","       Background:       People who get infected with COVID-19 have an unpredictable risk to worsen and die. This       makes it hard to decide who can quarantine at home and who should be treated at a hospital.       Researchers think the risk may be related to how a person s B and T cells respond to the       virus. B and T cells are the major components of a person s immune response. B and T cells       responding to the virus with a favorable pattern may lead to recovery, and this favorable       pattern may be helpful to establish. If people in a vaccine trial get this same favorable       pattern when responding to a vaccine, this may be a useful early signal that the vaccine will       be successful.       Objective:       To examine how immune cells respond to COVID-19 infection.       Eligibility:       Adults ages 18 and older who have a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection or had COVID-19       in the past.

This intervention will target the inpatient setting generally.       Scientific/Clinical Rationale for Approach Since emergence of the novel coronavirus, severe       acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) now designated coronavirus disease 2019       (COVID-19), one in six affected patients becomes seriously ill. The lung appears to be the       most susceptible target organ, with a large swath of symptomatic patients struggling with       mild upper respiratory tract illness and severe viral pneumonia resulting in respiratory       failure. This respiratory failure is often fatal, with one study showing 28% non-survivors       having experienced respiratory failure. Moreover, 81-97% of patients requiring mechanical       ventilation do not survive.       Like its interaction with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), angiotensin       converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the functional receptor for COVID-19. Viral adherence to       host-cell membrane associated ACE2 facilitates the proximity required for viral spike       mediated genetic material injection. In COVID-19, this spike is 10-20 times more likely to       bind ACE2 than SARS. ACE2 is expressed in 0.64% of all human lung cells, with 83% of those       cells being alveolar epithelial type II. In addition, gene ontology enrichment analysis       showed that the ACE2-expressing alveolar epithelial type II have high levels of multiple       viral process-related genes, including regulatory genes for viral processes, viral life       cycle, viral assembly, and viral genome replication, suggesting that the ACE2-expressing       alveolar epithelial type II cells facilitate coronaviral replication in the lung. Thus, these       cells likely serve as a ready reservoir for viral invasion. Perhaps more importantly,       alveolar type II cells function to generate and recycle surfactant essential to respiratory       activity. Surfactant defends against alveolar collapse at low lung volume and protects the       lung from injuries/infections caused by inhaled particles and micro-organisms. In COVID-19,       if these vital cells are being destroyed, alveolar failure may ensue with severe lung       impairment. Thus, interventions that are aimed at improving pressure normalization and       alveolar protection may be beneficial in these patients.       Prone positioning (PP) has long been used to combat hypoxemia in acute respiratory distress       syndrome (ARDS). Improvements in gas exchange result from improved alveolar ventilation and       blood flow redistribution with enhanced perfusion following. PP reduces lung over inflation       and bolsters alveolar recruitment. PP also promotes uniformity of vertical pleural pressure       gradients resulting in more uniform alveolar size. Considering these physiologic factors       together, the investigators hypothesize PP serves to balance stress and strain within the       lungs of non-critically ill patients with COVID-19 leading to improved outcomes compared to       traditional supine positioning.       Prior Research Supporting the Positioning Model:       Multiple studies have been conducted that support the use of PP as a proactive treatment to       combat hypoxemia in ARDS. Each year, approximately 170,000 people are diagnosed with ARDS,       and those diagnosed face mortality rates between 25% and 40%. The use of PP stretches back to       the 1970s, as providers began to search for ways to ameliorate ARDS symptomatology and reduce       the then even higher levels of mortality associated with it. Following initial reports that       PP significantly improved oxygenation in 70-80% of patients with ARDS, it was adopted as a       standard treatment option. Initially, randomized clinical trials struggled to replicate these       findings, citing multiple limitations to study enrollment and treatment standardization that       made ascertaining conclusive results difficult. Only as RCT construction has been refined to       accommodate for these limitations have the benefits of PP been more clearly demonstrated.       These beneficial effects have been recently upheld by the landmark PROSEVA study, a       multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial, that randomly assigned 466 patients       with severe ARDS to undergo prone-positioning sessions of at least 16 hours or to be left in       the supine position. Their results demonstrated a significant improvement in both 28- and       90-day mortality rates: the 28-day mortality was 16.0% in the prone group and 32.8% in the       supine group (P<0.001). The hazard ratio for death with prone positioning was 0.39 (95%       confidence interval [CI], 0.25 to 0.63). Unadjusted 90-day mortality was 23.6% in the prone       group versus 41.0% in the supine group (P<0.001), with a hazard ratio of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.29       to 0.67).       Per these positive findings, PP has been consistently shown to be an effective mechanism to       increase oxygenation in patients with ARDS when implemented under the following conditions:       early enlisting of treatment and its consistent maintenance for at least 16 hours per day,       and with concurrent use of lung-protective therapies. Translating these findings towards       treatment of COVID-19 positive patients seems promising given the similarity of manifested       symptoms and complications.     ","       This study aims to determine if provider-recommended guidance on supine (on back) vs. prone       (on stomach) positioning of patients testing positive for COVID-19 requiring supplemental       oxygen, but not yet mechanically ventilated, improves outcomes in the inpatient setting. This       study will be performed as a pragmatic clinical trial.

Recent data also shows that mortality among COVID-19 patients       is markedly higher in patients with elevated Troponin-T (TnT) levels than in patients with       normal TnT levels. Recently a cohort of 81 patients retrospectively evaluated diagnosed with       severe COVID-19 pneumonia and reported a lower extremity VTE incidence of 25% (20/81) and a       mortality of 40% (8/20) in the presence of VTE. Reported a case of bilateral pulmonary       embolism in a 75 year old woman diagnosed with severe COVID-19, in the absence of       predisposing risk factors and a negative lower extremity US. Lastly the investigated use of       Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) in the treatment of COVID-19 associated ARDS and reported       promising, but transient, results in terms of pulmonary function improvement. It appears that       either the SARS-CoV2 infection itself induces a hypercoagulable state, possibly by       hypofibrinolytic mechanisms, or the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients with severe disease       induces a prothrombotic state, which leads to clinical deterioration, hypoxia and hemodynamic       instability secondary to thromboembolic phenomena and potentially cardiac ischemia.       Preliminary data from Northwell Health System, which has one of the largest populations of       hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the US, reveals a positivity rate for deep vein thrombosis       (DVT) of 40% of those COVID-19 patients screened by Doppler compression ultrasonography of       the lower extremities.       Heparin has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties in addition       to its anticoagulation effect, which could play a beneficial role in sepsis. In addition,       there is in vitro evidence that the large negatively charged sulfated glycosaminoglycans of       unfractionated heparin may act as an alternate ligand for the SARS-CoV2 receptor irrespective       of ACE2. Whether this in vitro evidence supports the role of a protective or deleterious       mechanism in COVID-19 infection is not known. However, an early report with empiric use of       treatment dose unfractionated heparin (UFH) in ARDS from a different viral family, influenza       H1N1, revealed that H1N1 ARDS patients under systemic anticoagulation had 33-fold fewer VTE       events than those treated given prophylactic doses of UFH/low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH)       thromboprophylaxis. Very recent evidence suggests that therapy with prophylactic to       intermediate doses of the LMWH enoxaparin (30mg to 60mg QD) in severe hospitalized COVID-19       patents with a SIC score ≥ 4 or D-dimer (Dd) > 6 X ULN improves outcomes and prognosis.       All-cause mortality at 28 days was reduced from 64.2% to 40.0% in those patients with a SIC       score ≥ 4 (p=0.029), and from 52.4% to 32.8% in those patients with an elevated Dd > 6 x ULN       (P=0.017). Notably, Klok and colleagues investigated 184 ICU patients infected with COVID-19       and reported a 13% mortality rate, a relatively high incidence of CTPA- or       ultrasonography-confirmed VTE rate (27%), and arterial thrombotic events (3.7%) despite the       use of standard dose thromboprophylaxis. Postulated mechanisms for the improved prognosis       with the use of treatment doses of LMWH in the sick COVID-19 population include the decrease       in the risk of microthrombi, especially in the pulmonary vasculature, which can lead to       hypoxemia, pulmonary vasoconstriction and right ventricular dysfunction as well as the       decrease in the risk of progression to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy as a       contributor to the high mortality seen in these patients.       The optimal dose of heparin (either LMWH or UFH) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is       unknown, as patients on conventional prophylactic dose heparin (UFH or LMWH) as supported by       international guidance statements on hospitalized COVID-19 patients appear to remain at risk       for thromboembolic events. There is data to support improved efficacy with treatment doses of       twice daily enoxaparin versus once-daily weight-adjusted enoxaparin for the management of       VTE, especially with large thrombus burden. There is also long-standing data to support that       treatment-dose heparin can reduce major cardiovascular events. Our current standard of care       in our 24 hospital Northwell Health System, which has a very large hospitalized COVID-19       patient population, is to use Lovenox 40mg SQ QD for patients with a BMI < 30 and Creatinine       Clearance (CrCl) > 15ml/min, Lovenox 40mg SQ BID for patients with a BMI > 30 and CrCl >       15ml/min, and UFH 5000U SQ BID or TID in patients with a CrCl < 15ml/min and BMI < 30 and UFH       7500U SQ BID or TID with a CrCl < 15ml/min and BMI > 30. Large healthcare institutions in the       US and elsewhere have protocols for in-patient thromboprophylaxis ranging from       prophylactic-to-intermediate dose UFH or LMWH for the management of patients with COVID-19       associated coagulopathy. The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that prophylaxis of       severe COVID-19 patients with treatment dose LMWH leads to better thromboembolic-free       outcomes and associated complications during hospitalization than prophylaxis with       institutional standard of care with prophylactic to intermediate-doses of UFH or LMWH.

Treatment arm       In addition to the local standard of care for COVID 19 patients, the patient will receive       colchicine PO as such:         -  Loading dose of 1.2 mg followed by 0.6mg after 2 hours if without significant            gastrointestinal symptoms (day 1)         -  The next day 0.6mg bid for 14 days or until discharge       Patients who are on HMG-Co A Reductase Inhibitors (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin,       simvastatin), fibrates, genfibrozil, amiodarone, dronedarone or digoxin should have the       colchicine dosage reduced to a loading dose of 0.6mg followed by 0.3mg after two hours (day       1) followed by 0.3mg BID for 14 days or until discharge.       If patients have significant gastrointestinal symptoms after loading, the dosage may be       reduced to 0.3mg BID for the rest of the 14 day course or until discharge. If       gastrointestinal symptoms continue, the medication should then be discontinued. Patients who       experience sensory motor neuropathy, or symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with       rhabdomyolysis should prompt immediate discontinuation of the drug. If renal function       deteriorates during the treatment course and CrCl <30ml/min, colchicine should also be       discontinued.

Since the primary clinical endpoint is progression of disease, if the patient requires beyond       8L nasal cannula, eg. high flow O2 or mechanical ventilation, the primary clinical endpoint       is met and the above experimental medications will be permitted. To rephrase, the patient       will be allowed, Remdesivir, IL-6 inhibitors and other immunomodulators if then deemed       medically necessary by the treating physician.     ","       The most prevalent complication of COVID-19 infection is respiratory failure from severe       acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the leading cause of mortality. There is increasing       indication that the decompensation in severe COVD-19 infection may be due to a cytokine storm       syndrome. This hyperinflammatory syndrome results in a fulminant and fatal hypercytokinemia       and multiorgan failure.       Approximately 15% of patients with COVID-19 infection are hospitalized and 20-30% of these       hospitalized patients require ICU care and/or mechanical ventilation. Overall mortality in       hospitalized patients is approximately 20-25%. There is significant interest in therapies       that can be given upstream to reduce the rate of mechanical ventilation and thus mortality.       We hypothesize that treatment with colchicine in COVID-19 moderate-severe patients may       decrease the risk of progression into ARDS requiring increased oxygen requirements,       mechanical ventilation, and mortality.

NCT04360954,2020-04-23,Completed,,Observational,Evaluation of Antibody Tests for COVID-19,Evaluation of Commerical Antibody Tests for COVID-19,COVID|Coronavirus,Diagnostic test,All,18,,,63110,,,,Case-Only,,"       Background       Molecular (RT-PCR) tests are currently the gold standard for diagnosis of COVID-19. They       detect viral RNA and are a good marker for current infection and infectivity. However, these       tests are expensive and in short supply. In advanced COVID-19 cases, virus concentration in       the upper respiratory tract is often low, as the infection has spread to the lungs and viral       RNA is sometimes undetectable by RT-PCR using nasal swaps. Antibody tests detect human       antibodies to viral proteins in the blood or other body fluids. They could be useful for       diagnosing current infections (slightly less sensitive than RT-PCR tests), and they remain       positive after persons have recovered from the infection. Thus, antibody tests are expected       to be useful for diagnosis of current infections, for verifying recent infections in persons       who were not tested by RT-PCR when they were ill, and for documenting possible immunity to       the virus. Antibody tests may be especially valuable for use in low and middle income       countries that lack resources for widespread molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection.       Anticipated test sensitivity and specificity. Manufacturer data for several antibody tests       claim that more than 90% of persons with COVID-19 (clinical symptoms and positive molecular       tests) have positive antibody test results for IgM and/or IgG. They also claim specificity in       the range of 93-95% for samples from persons who have not been exposed to SARS-CoV-2.       Availability of antibody tests. In recent months, many antibody tests have been developed and       marketed. The Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND, closely linked to World Health       Organization (WHO) and supported by a large grant from the United Kingdom government) in       Geneva Switzerland reported that they had identified more than 70 such tests, and they       shortlisted 27 tests for further evaluation. Of these, only one test produced in the USA       (produced by Cellex) has received an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the US FDA, and       no test has formal FDA approval. Antibody tests use different diagnostic platforms, but most       tests use the SARS-CoV-2 S1protein, and a few tests also use the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Few       studies that independently evaluated the performance of these rapid antibody tests have been       published to date in peer-reviewed journals. Therefore, more data are needed to evaluate the       sensitivity, specificity, and value of these tests.       Methods       The Weil Lab research group at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) has extensive       experience developing and evaluating rapid format diagnostic tests for infectious diseases.       The group has special interest in infectious disease diagnostics that can be used in low and       middle income countries and is used to work under challenging conditions after disease       outbreaks. In this project, rapid-format antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 will be evaluated and       antibody test results will be compared with results of RT-PCR and metadata (age, gender,       clinical symptoms, time after exposure when known).       Patient samples. Deidentified serum or plasma samples will be tested from patients who have       been hospitalized and tested positive for COVID-19. Control samples from our serum bank       (deidentified samples from healthy humans and samples from persons with parasitic diseases)       will also be tested. The number of serum or plasma samples to be tested will be left open,       but this will depend in part on the number of samples available and the availability of test       kits. It is anticipated that approximately 500 samples will be tested initially, but more may       be tested if that is necessary to achieve study objectives. The tests and research are for       research only, and we will not report test results from individual patient samples to       clinicians to support patient care.       Note: No voluntary enrolment into this study will be conducted; all testing is to be       conducted anonymously.       Antibody test kits. Marketed commercial or prototype antibody detection kits will be obtained       by donation or purchase. Tests to be evaluated are to be determined, but this will depend on       availability and cost. The focus will be on rapid-format, point-of-care antibody test kits       that detect both IgM and IgG antibodies to recombinant viral proteins. The goal is to test at       least five (5) different kits including at least two (2) that are manufactured in the USA.       Test procedures. Manufacturers'' package inserts or protocols for test performance will be       followed. These vary across different test platforms. Persons who perform the tests will not       know PCR results or other metadata associated with the human samples when they perform the       tests. Tests will be read by two independent readers and recorded. A third reader will be the       deciding vote for cases with discordant readings.       Test data. Antibody test results (IgM and IgG) for each different test kit will be entered       into a test result form with the participant''s unique identifier number (UI). Results will       later be merged into a database that contains the UI and metadata such as age, sex, fever,       cough, date sample was collected, date of symptom onset, exposure history (travel, household,       work). Acceptability of test performance will be judged according to a working target product       profile (TPP) appended at the end of this protocol.       Primary objective       1. To assess the sensitivity and specificity of tests for antibody to SARS-CoV-2, the virus       that causes COVID-19 disease. Separate criteria will be used to define sensitivity for acute       and convalescent samples.         1. Sensitivity for diagnosis of acute cases will be defined as % positivity in samples from            symptomatic cases with positive RT-PCR results. .         2. Sensitivity for detecting antibody in convalescent samples expressed as % will be the            number of positive antibody tests divided by the number of samples tested from persons            with documented past infections (by RT-PCR) who are now at least 2 weeks past resolution            of symptoms and currently RT-PCR negative.         3. Sensitivity will also be defined as % agreement with results from a reference antibody            test as soon as one is identified.         4. Specificity will be defined as the % of negative control samples (collected prior to            1/1/2020) that have negative antibody test results.       Secondary Objectives         1. To determine relationships between the time after infection or onset of symptoms of            COVID-19 and the presence of antibodies to the virus as determined by antibody test            kits.         2. To determine the duration of antibody responses following infection.         3. To compare background reactivity (false positive rates) for sera from the USA vs. sera            from developing countries in areas where chronic parasitic infections and consumption of            bushmeat are common or where people live in close relationship with wildlife that may be            a reservoir for zoonotic viruses.         4. To assess test performance characteristics (ease of use).       Benefits to participants. None       Benefits to society. Antibody tests may be useful for diagnosis of infection and for       documentation of past infection. Independent test validation studies are critically       important. That is because test results from companies may be biased. In addition, companies       often do not report on the user friendliness of rapid diagnostics. Antibody tests may be       especially valuable for use in low and middle income countries that lack resources for       widespread molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection.     ","       The purpose of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of several marketed       commercial or prototype test kits for antibody to SARS-CoV-2.

Surge of patients requiring hospital admission have led to shortages of ICU beds and       mechanical ventilators. As an emerging clinical entity, little is known about the precise       pathophysiologic mechanisms of COVID-19. Recent observational data and clinical experience       has suggested that there could be different phenotypes of patients with COVID-19 which could       explain the wide range of clinical presentations, response to therapies and outcomes.       Point of care cardiac and lung ultrasound (CLUS) has been proposed as a tool with potential       to assist diagnostic evaluation and management of COVID-19 patients in the emergency       department (ED) and intensive care unit (ICU) settings. Point of care CLUS is routinely used       as part of the clinical evaluation of patients with dyspnea, hypoxemia, chest pain and shock       in the ED and ICU. Patients with COVID-19 commonly present to the ED with these symptoms and       therefore CLUS is being commonly used in patients with suspected or confirmed diagnosis of       COVID-19.       Small observational studies have described several lung ultrasound (LUS) findings in patients       with COVID-19. These findings include; pleural irregularity (thickening), subpleural       consolidations, air bronchogram, isolated B-lines, fused B-lines and pleural effusions. Other       observational studies have described the presence of acute myocardial abnormalities in       patients with COVID-19 seen in echocardiography, including left and right ventricular       systolic dysfunction.       Multiple studies have described and validated the finding of B-lines in LUS as a non-invasive       marker of extravascular lung water. B-lines in LUS correlate with pulmonary capillary wedge       pressures, NT-proBNP and E/e'' and has been validated as a reliable prognostic factor in       patients with decompensated heart failure. B-lines are also found in other pulmonary       processes including viral pneumonia, ARDS, pulmonary contusions and post radiation changes.       Observational studies involving COVID-19 patients have shown the presence of isolated and       fused or continuous B-lines in the pneumonia associated with this infection. We hypothesize       that the presence of B-lines in LUS may be marker of severity, and that alone or in concert       with other clinical or laboratory variables, could help predict the clinical course and       prognosis of COVID-19 patients.       Knowledge gaps         1. Does point of care cardiopulmonary ultrasound findings alone, or combined with other            clinical and/or laboratory variables, predict clinical outcomes of patients with            COVID-19?         2. Can different lung ultrasound finding patterns correlate with clinical severity or            outcomes?       Specific aims         1. To characterize various clinical and CLUS findings and describe their relationship with            clinical course of patients with COVID-19 in ED and ICU.         2.

The APPEX-19 study is a pragmatic       adaptive randomized controlled unblinded trial. The study compares a smartphone tool that       recommends non-ICU patients with COVID-19 or who are under evaluation for COVID-19 to lie in       a prone position (i.e, with their stomach and chest facing down) to usual care.       Participants who are assigned to the intervention arm will receive a text message containing       a link to an online website that reviews how to safely self-prone position and a       recommendation to self-prone position 4 times for 1-2 hours each during the day and at night       every 24 hours. Participants will also receive twice daily reminders to self-prone using the       same smartphone platform.       All participants will receive twice daily Qualtrics online surveys to answer questions about       which body positions they used in bed and their level of comfort and shortness of breath.       Participants will receive these twice daily text messages until they are discharged, until       they are transferred to the ICU, until they die, until their lung function declines, or until       14 days pass since enrollment. Thus, most participants will receive twice daily text messages       for about 1 week; it is expected that almost all patients will receive twice daily text       messages for no longer than 14 days. Medical charts will be reviewed daily to track routine       clinical data to determine outcomes.       Boston Medical Center (BMC) / Boston University will be one of the 16 sites and the data       coordinating center for this multisite trial. The unique design of the study means that if       evidence accumulates that one treatment is better than the other, more participants will be       chosen to receive the prone position intervention that works over time. Thus, the trial will       both show what works, implement what works, and make sure that the most participants receive       the treatment that works.     ","       Prone positioning is a well studied and validated treatment for severe acute respiratory       distress syndrome (ARDS), however there are no randomized studies on the use of prone       positioning in the non-intubated patient.

Subjects will be tracked for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and CD4,       and CD8 T cell responses throughout the period and especially during the early stages after       clearance of infection and subsequently to determine the quality and duration of memory       responses.       In addition to blood samples, participants will intermittently provide nasal swabs for       detection of SARS-CoV-2; this will occur either through a comprehensive proactive employee       screening program, or specifically for the purposes of the research study if participants are       required to attend campus but are not currently eligible for employee screening. These will       determine duration and characteristics of viral shedding and identify reinfection.       Seroprevalence estimates and asymptomatic conversion will also be determined.       Individuals with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection will have two additional blood draws in       the acute and convalescent phase to identify acute and late immune responses. These responses       will be compared to the essential baseline sample data to characterize the generation of de       novo and cross-reactive recall responses.       At enrollment, subjects will complete a baseline online personal health and demographic       questionnaire, and then monthly brief online health update questionnaires.

It is critical for cancer patients at home to monitor       early indications of COVID-19 symptoms, to adhere to mitigation strategies, as well as to       manage their cancer-related symptoms so that patients can decrease the need to utilize the       emergency department or unplanned hospitalizations for symptom care, which is a common       occurrence during cancer care. Remote monitoring adds a layer of home-based support which can       benefit all cancer patients and is not restricted to geographic proximity to oncology       providers or distance from a cancer center. The Symptom Care at Home (SCH) system, utilized       for the Principal Investigator''s currently funded R01CA206522 project to monitor and manage       patient-reported (PRO) cancer symptoms, includes these necessary elements: remote PRO symptom       monitoring, patient self-management information, and oncology provider (nurse practitioner)       notification of symptoms exceeding pre-set thresholds.

There will       be a specific focus on demographic differences including age, gender, and race.       Enrolled volunteers are seen at San Francisco General Hospital at baseline, monthly for 3       months and then every 3 months for up to 2 years. Visits include a detailed interview, saliva       collection, and a blood draw. Baseline visits take approximately 90 minutes, and follow up       visits take approximately 20-40 minutes. No personal identifiers are used for specimen bank       samples.     ","       LIINC is a study of volunteers who were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 (also known as       novel coronavirus or COVID-19) who have recovered from acute infection. The study is designed       to provide a specimen bank of samples with carefully characterized clinical data. LIINC       specimens will be used to examine multiple questions involving the virologic, immunologic,       and host factors involved in COVID-19, with a focus on understanding variability in the       long-term immune response between individuals.

Study population: High risk HCW with direct patient contacts, defined as physician       assistants, respiratory therapists, nurses, physicians or other HCWs working at emergency       rooms, ICUs and in locations within hospitals where COVID-infected patients are treated.       Intervention: Participants will be randomized between intradermal administration of BCG       vaccine or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.       Recruitment, Randomization, treatment allocation, and blinding       A standardized, IRB approved email will be sent to department chairs describing the study. A       research coordinator will reach out to interested participants via phone with the help of an       IRB-approved verbal script to introduce the study, confirm eligibility and provide further       instructions on how to access and sign the IRB-approved ICD via REDCap using their own       electronic devices. It is important that the investigators obtain the consent via REDCAp to       a) avoid direct person-to-person contact and comply with social distancing imposed       recommendations, and b) minimize the waste of reconstituted BCG by allowing the research       personnel to schedule vaccinations in a controlled fashion. Patient registration into the       trial will happen immediately after consent has been provided and will involve entering of       baseline information into an electronic data capture system (RedCap).       Once the eligibility is confirmed and the ICD signed by the participant and stored in REDCap,       the research coordinator will randomize the participant and communicate the treatment       assignment to the nurse administering the vaccination. The nurse will subsequently assign an       appointment and communicate date and time of vaccination with the participant. All eligible       participants will receive intradermal injections of BCG:placebo in a 1:1 ratio.       Both, participants and investigators will be blinded to the treatment assignments during the       study. However, in case of an emergency where it is important to know the treatment received,       the investigator and/or participant can reach out to the unblinded study personnel who will       provide the unblinded data. All participants will receive their treatment allocation at the       end of the study, after the data analysis is finalized.       Unblinded personnel will not be involved in the collection and analysis of study data other       than the baseline eligibility criteria.       The end of the study is defined as the last patient''s last entry in the electronic data       capture system.       Informed Consent and Eligibility       The following types of procedures will be conducted as indicated below:       Medical history will be obtained from patient medical record/clinical chart. Informed Consent       will be obtained to access these records. When information cannot be obtained or is not       available from the patient medical record/clinical chart, it will be obtained via patient       interview. Physical examination will be conducted solely to look for existing BCG vaccination       scars.       Symptom evaluation will be conducted via an electronic survey administered to participants       every 1-3 days.       HIV and pregnancy will be collected as self-reported information. If unknown, a urine       pregnancy test will be performed.       Nasopharyngeal, oral and/ or rectal swabs will be collected for rt-PCR test for SARS-CoV2       infection if a study develops symptoms consistent with Covid-19.       If a participant does not know their PPD/IGRA status from within the last 24 months (all       health care providers should have this information), an IGRA can be performed to evaluate       eligibility.       Study participants have the option of donating blood via phlebotomy (for serological test for       Covid-19 disease and PBMCs for immune correlates) or providing a fingerstick and dried blood       spot (for serologic test for Covid-19).       Data will be collected at four time points/periods: (1) after consent, (2) at baseline, (3)       during follow-up period, and (4) at study end.       Data to be collected during screening includes medical history, physical exam results,       results of rt-PCR and serological test results.       Data to be collected during baseline enrollment includes eligibility confirmation,       demographic information, risk factors, randomization assignment, confirmation of BCG       vaccination/placebo, any immediate reactions to BCG vaccination/placebo.       Data to be collected during follow-up includes intermittent surveys about the presence of       flu-like symptoms, rt-PCR test results if done, serological test results, if testing positive       for Covid-19 information regarding their disease course, and disease outcome status.

Note that this is part of routine surveillance for Covid-19 in health workers at       the United States site. Consent forms will ask for consent to access this survey information.       Any positive response on the survey will trigger a nasopharyngeal, oral and/ or rectal swab       to be collected to test for Covid-19 via rt-PCR       All participants, regardless of survey responses, will have serology for Covid-19 tested at 4       week intervals during the follow-up period (6 months)       If a participant completes the follow-up period and does not test positive for disease, their       study participation is complete       If a participant does test positive for disease, their disease status will be ascertained for       up to two months or until an outcome is available through one of the following mechanisms:       (1) an electronic survey if they are not admitted to the hospital, including questions about       the number of days they are ill, daily fever, and other symptoms; or (2) (2) if they are       admitted to the hospital, ordinal outcomes for disease severity will be extracted from the       hospital¿s electronic medical records system.       During the first week of follow-up, all participants will actively be asked about any adverse       events; thereafter, participants will report unsolicited AEs through the electronic survey.       Vaccine related adverse events will be graded using the FDA guidance       (https://www.fda.gov/media/73679/download) and noted using WHO-recommended Adverse event       following Immunization forms (AEFI;       https://vaccine-safety-training.org/classification-of-aefis.html).       Participants will have the option of donating 12 mL of blood for plasma (serology) and PBMCs       for secondary analysis of immune correlates and for future analysis based on covid19-specific       IgM and IgG. If they do not donate 12mL of blood, a fingerstick will be required for baseline       COVID19 serology.       Dried Blood Spot (DBS): all participants are HCWs and will self-collect DBS samples at week       4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24. Envelopes to store the DBS are provided upon enrollment and can be       dropped off at work and picked up by study coordinators to minimize HCW distractions.       COVID specific RNA is found in stool for ~21 days when an individual develops infection       (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2196-x). Participants will have the option of collecting       stool swabs monthly if they are asymptomatic or weekly if they develop symptoms. Nucleic acid       testing will be performed in retrospect to support secondary objectives.       If participants develop symptoms consistent with COVD19, will be PCR tested for COVID19. They       will be given the option of donating 12 mL of blood for plasma and PBMCs 2 weeks after       symptoms resolve.       Week 12 (+/- 2 Weeks), participants will be given the option to donate 12 mL of blood for       plasma and PBMCs for secondary analysis of immune correlates and for future secondary       analysis based on covid-specific IgM and IgG.       Week 24 (+/- 2 Weeks), participants will be given the option to donate 12 mL of blood for       plasma and       PBMCs for secondary analysis of immune correlates and for future secondary analysis based on       covid-specific IgM and IgG.       Except for the administration of BCG vaccine or placebo and the above mentioned DBS and       phlebotomy, participants will undergo no invasive procedures for study purposes.       The following data points will be collected during the follow-up period AND AT       END OF STUDY TIMEPOINT:       Sore throat (collected at multiple time points)       Fever (collected at multiple time points)       Headache (collected at multiple time points)       Malaise (collected at multiple time points)       Cough (collected at multiple time points)       rt-PCR test for SARS-CoV2 result (as indicated)       Serological test for Covid-19 result (every 2 weeks)       Number of days ill       Daily fever       Other Covid-19 symptoms       Admitted to hospital       Required oxygen       Treated in intensive care       Required ventilation       Death       Severe pneumonia       Respiratory failure       Acute respiratory distress syndrome       Sepsis       Septic shock       *Already being collected as part of routine surveillance of health care workers. Will request       access to this information in Informed Consent Form.       Subjects can leave the study at any time for any reason if they wish to do so without any       consequences. The investigator can decide to withdraw a subject from the study for urgent       medical reasons. Participants who received placebo will be unblinded at the end of the study       and pending a recommendation by the DSMB, they will be offered the option of receiving the       BCG intervention.       A participant will only be replaced in case of withdrawal before the administration of BCG       vaccine/placebo.     ","       SARS-CoV-2 spreads rapidly throughout the world. A large epidemic would seriously challenge       the available hospital capacity, and this would be augmented by infection of healthcare       workers (HCW). Strategies to prevent infection and disease severity of HCW are, therefore,       desperately needed to safeguard continuous patient care. Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is a       vaccine against tuberculosis, with protective non-specific effects against other respiratory       tract infections in in vitro and in vivo studies, and reported morbidity and mortality       reductions as high as 70%. Furthermore, in our preliminary analysis, areas with existing BCG       vaccination programs appear to have lower incidence and mortality from COVID191. The       investigators hypothesize that BCG vaccination can reduce HCW infection and disease severity       during the epidemic phase of SARS-CoV-2.     ",The primary outcome measure is the development of COVID19 infection. We will use the Cox proportional-hazards model to calculate hazard ratios for the development of Covid-19.

Duration of the       participation varies based on the symptom severity. With the currently available information,       recovery times are ranging from 7 days to 56 days. The duration of the study participation       can begin at the early detection to all the way until complete recovery or discharge.       Participants may be asked to use the sensors anywhere from 7 days to 60 days. Duration of       study will be based on the participant''s self-reported symptoms or as appropriate determined       by the PI.

Different types of sensors can be used to monitor these digital biomarkers. Inertial       measurement units (IMUs), including accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers are typically       used to measure physical activity, movement signatures. Miniature temperature, galvanic skin       response (GSR), photoplethysmogram (PPG), oxygen saturation (SPO2) sensors are increasingly       embedded in wearable devices for vital sign monitoring. Non-invasive monitoring is very ideal       in the current pandemic situation. These sensors can be potentially deployed in large scale       to monitor cases of suspected infection and patients recovering from COVID-19.

Currently without an effective       treatment for SARS-CoV-2 there is an urgent need for effective treatment to curtail the rate       of respiratory failure, the leading cause of mortality in COVID-19 disease. Moreover, with       increasing numbers of patients requiring intensive unit level care and mechanical       ventilation, nations are already having to triage patients for ventilatory support due to       limited resources and healthcare systems around the world being stretched to the point of       collapse, highlighting the importance of identifying interventions that could prevent the       development of respiratory failure for these patients.       The disease course of COVID-19 includes an incubation period, an acute viral phase that most       commonly presents with flu-like symptoms that in some individuals progresses to a severe       hyperinflammatory phase marked by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hypoxemic       respiratory failure.Though there is spectrum of clinical course, many progress to the       hyperinflammatory phase around day seven of symptoms, often requiring intensive care unit       (ICU) level care and mechanical ventilation. Accumulating evidence suggests that the       pathophysiology underlying this profound decline is a severe inflammatory response as       demonstrated by multi organ system dysfunction akin to cytokine release syndrome       (CRS)/macrophage activation syndrome (MAS).CRS/MAS is a systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome       on a spectrum with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), typically       characterized by multiorgan failure that is often triggered by viral infections in the       setting of excessive immune activation, typically with marked hyperferritinemia.Postmortem       assessment of patients with COVID-19 have demonstrated pathologic findings consistent with       MAS such as mono/lymphocytic infiltrates within the lung parenchyma with associated edema and       alveolar congestion, splenic necrosis with macrophage proliferation and hemophagocytosis, as       well as a lymphocyte/histiocyte predominate infiltrate of portal vasculature accompanying       liver necrosis and sinusoidal congestion.Cytokine profiling of patients with MAS/sHLH       overlaps with that seen in patients with severe COVID-19 and includes elevated levels of       IL-1, IL-2, IL-7, IL-6, G-CSF, MCP- 1, and TNF-α as well as elevated D-dimer, C-reactive       protein, LDH and troponins.Moreover, preliminary data from a non-randomized series of       COVID-19 patients with severe or critical COVID-19 from China who were treated with       tocilizumab (in addition to standard therapies) showed they had dramatic improvement in       fever, arterial oxygen saturation and inflammatory markers within the first 24-hours       following administration.       Taken together, these data strongly suggest an immunologic link between COVID-19 and immune       dysregulation resulting in MAS. Clinical trials are already underway studying the role of       immunomodulatory therapy including modulation of IL-1 and IL-6 and downstream pathways in the       setting of CAR-T induced MAS (NCT04150913, NCT04071366) and agents such anakinra and       tocilizumab have been used in this context with promising results and good safety profiles.       There is an urgent and dire need to study the therapeutic role for immunomodulatory therapy       in COVID-19 disease to both halt disease progression in patients at an individual level and       prevent the inevitable saturation of healthcare resources at a systems level, to which end       there are numerous ongoing international trials to expand these efforts into the setting of       COVID-19 infection (ChiCTR2000029765, NCT04324021, TOCOVID-19). Based on the MGH experience       thus far with COVID-19, including over 200 patients to date, the need for mechanical       ventilation has been approximately 30%. With the upcoming surge anticipated between April       17th and 21st we expect the need for hundreds of additional ICU beds. Investigators propose a       trial of IL-6 receptor blockade with tocilizumab given early in disease course to try to       prevent progression of COVID-19.     ","       This is a randomized, double blind, multi-center study to evaluate the effects of tocilizumab       compared to placebo on patient outcomes in participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection       and evidence of systemic inflammation.       The aim of this study is to test the effect of Tocilizumab on multi-organ dysfunction in a       phase 3 randomized controlled trial among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection.       Specifically, as compared to placebo, we will test whether tocilizumab is associated with a       reduction in multi-organ dysfunction among hospitalized COVID-19 adult patients with elevated       inflammatory measures. Multi-organ dysfunction will be measured as the incidence of the       following composite endpoint (mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, mechanical       support, need for inotropes or vasopressors, liver dysfunction (increased bilirubin), and       all-cause mortality). We will also assess multiple pre-specified secondary (exploratory)       endpoints and safety endpoints.       We hypothesize that, as compared to placebo, tocilizumab will reduce transfer to the ICU,       need for mechanical ventilation, increase rates of hospital discharge in patients diagnosed       with severe COVID-19 infection and evidence of exaggerated inflammatory response.

This data is urgently needed to assist in care and promote       recovery of COVID-19 patients worldwide, and elderly patients who are at higher risk due to       increased age, pre-existing risk factors (frailty, sarcopenia, malnutrition), and co-morbid       conditions. Further, new pathologies such as COVID-19-related cardiac dysfunction must be       described and rapidly identified. Our innovative measurements will provide direct       non-invasive assessments of the effect of COVID-19 infection on key measures including energy       expenditure, substrate utilization, muscle mass, cardiac function, mitochondrial function,       and body composition. In addition, we will be able to provide objective data on key recovery       intervention requirements including energy/nutritional requirements, effects of nutrition and       rehabilitation efforts on muscle mass and energy state, and recovery of cardiac, muscle       function.       Study Questions: We propose to evaluate longitudinal metabolic and cardiac pathophysiology in       patients with COVID-19 to understand, guide and optimize our metabolic clinical care during       acute hospitalization. Further, this data will be essential in providing objective data to       guide physical recovery interventions including nutrition delivery and physical therapy to       ensure functional recovery of COVID-19 patients.       We hypothesize: 1) COVID-19 will lead to significant, EE/metabolic changes, systemic       mitochondrial dysfunction, significant muscle wasting and loss of function throughout the       course of illness and during recovery. We hypothesize metabolic needs will initially decrease       in acute illness and subsequently increase as patients transition from the acute phase of       COVID illness to recovery phases. This data will guide nutrition and metabolic/clinical care       in all phases of COVID-19 care where, for example, over-and under-feeding may pose risk to       patient outcome. We hypothesize loss of muscle mass and physical function occurring in       COVID-19 will significantly affect nutritional/rehabilitative/recovery of function/QoL needs       and requires addressing to personalize care to optimize clinical and functional recovery       efforts in older COVID-19 patients.       We believe longitudinal detailed indirect calorimetry with the innovative new Q-NRG device,       cardiac assessment, body composition, and muscle and ultrasound measures in COVID-19 patients       will play a key role in understanding and treating COVID-19 infection by providing objective       data on the metabolic, cardiac, volume/fluid status, and nutrition needs of COVID-19 patients       to the bedside clinician. This will increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of       COVID-19 and the ability of clinical teams to optimize care and patient outcomes. These       urgently needed data will lead to key advances in the clinical care of COVID-19 patients       worldwide.     ","       This current proposal evaluates the Longitudinal Energy Expenditure and Metabolic Effects in       Patients with COVID-19 (LEEP-COVID) to understand, guide and optimize our metabolic and       nutritional care of these high risk patients.

Animal model studies of SARS suggest that the age and sex difference in COVID19 symptom       severity may be due to protective and acute actions of the female sex hormone estrogen.       Animal and human studies support immune modulating effects of estrogen that are acute acting       in viral infections and wound repair processes that may reduce the damaging effects of the       virus on the lung and symptom severity.       Our hypothesis is that a short 7 day course of estradiol delivered in a transdermal patch       applied to the upper buttock in COVID19+ or presumptive positive patients will be safe and       will reduce symptom severity in adult men and older women when given prior to intubation.       COVID19+ and presumptive positive patients not requiring intubation will be enrolled to the       study and randomized to receive an estrogen patch or standard of care.

Here the       investigators propose a medical records and excess clinical material study to determine       whether anesthetic isoflurane can treat COVID-19. Specifically, inhalation anesthetics,       including isoflurane, inhibit the replication of an RNA virus. In addition, anesthesia       machines have been used to provide mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 patients at MGH and at       other hospitals. Finally, due to the shortage of intravenous anesthetic propofol, inhalation       anesthetics including isoflurane, delivered by the anesthesia machine, are currently used to       sedate COVID-19 patients during mechanic ventilation. Moreover, isoflurane is very       economical, e.g. $6 (isoflurane) versus $1200 (propofol) per patient per day in sedating       COVID-19 patients. As such, the investigators propose to use this already established system       in COVID-19 patients to determine whether isoflurane, delivered to lungs, can treat COVID-19       and especially COVID-19 pneumonia. In summary, the proposed study is a low risk observation       research using the already established clinical care system of COVID-19 patients and the       investigators will NOT have any additional procedures required for research purpose. The       investigators will also collect the left-over clinical sample and then use nanotechnology to       achieve fast detection of IgM/IgG ratio as the biomarker of the progress of COVID-19       following the isoflurane or propofol sedation.       Specifically, inhalation anesthetics, including isoflurane, inhibit replication of the       measles virus and other RNA virus 1,2. Severe COVID-19 patients need mechanical ventilation       to support lung function. The anesthesia machine can be used to ventilate lungs in these       patients in addition to regular ventilators which has already been started at MGH and other       hospitals as regular ventilators are extremely limited. Clinicians have already determined       the settings of these machines, including humidification, for treating COVID-19 patients and       the investigators will use these predetermined settings in this study. Additionally, there is       a shortage of the intravenous anesthetic propofol. As a result, inhalation anesthetics       including isoflurane, delivered by the anesthesia machine, are currently used to sedate       COVID-19 patients during mechanic ventilation. Moreover, isoflurane is very economical, e.g.       $6 (isoflurane) versus $1200 (propofol) per patient per day in sedating COVID-19 patients. As       such, the investigators propose to use this already established system in COVID-19 patients       to determine whether isoflurane, delivered to lungs, can treat COVID-19 and especially       COVID-19 pneumonia better than other sedatives in this retrospective data collection study.       Moreover, in pre-clinical studies, the investigators propose to establish a system to       determine whether inhalation anesthetics can treat virus-induced pneumonia by reducing the       amount of virus, e.g., SARS-CoV-2 and influenza.       Sensitive, cost-effective and fast detection of SARS-CoV-2 is extremely critical. Currently,       a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test detects the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2.       However, the test has large false negatives, poses risks during specimen collection and       sample handling, and takes a long time (~ 8 hours). However, in response to SARS-CoV-2, IgG       is the most abundant immunoglobulin to be produced and is maintained in the body after       initial exposure for a long-term response. IgM is the first immunoglobulin to be produced but       is primarily detected during the early onset of disease. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 specific       IgM/IgG ratio in blood could be used as biomarker for COVID-19 prognostics (Fatma et al,       medRxiv, 2020), and could also be used as a measure of drug response 3. The nanoneedle       technology developed at a startup-company from Harvard University (NanoMosaic LLC) provides       pg/ml-level sensitivity and 10 uL sample volume for quantification of a panel of biomarkers       including SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgMs in a single assay. The technology uses nanoneedle       biosensors densely integrated on a silicon chip and manufactured with CMOS-compatible       nanofabrication processes 4. Each nanoneedle is a label-free biosensor and changes its       scattering spectrum when an antigen binds to its surface. Each analyte-specific sensing area       consists of a total of ~24k nanoneedles divided into a digital region (~20k nanoneedles), an       analog region (~3k nanoneedles) and a fabrication QC region (~1k nanoneedles), thus providing       a wider dynamic range beyond the digital counting concentration ranges. Each single analyte       area, including both digital and analog sensors, is less than 500 um. With further       development, the entire assay can be finished in a half-hour on a table-top instrument with       less than 10 ul blood samples, which will facilitate therapeutic development and decision       making for COVID-19 and other virus-induced pneumoniae.     ","       This is a blood collection and retrospective data collection study. The investigators plan to       assess whether the sedative drug, isoflurane, can treat COVID-19 patients relatively better       compared to other sedative drugs given during routine treatment to patients on mechanical       ventilation. The investigators will also use nanoneedle biosensors to quickly detect blood       IgM/IgG ratio in those patients, and (3) to establish a pre-clinical system to determine the       effects of inhalational anesthetics on amounts of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses, and       pneumoniae.

While COVID-19 patients have       an increased need for supportive care, there is currently no specific treatment directed       against 2019-nCoV. Nitric oxide inhalation has been used as a pulmonary vasodilator and has       been found to have antiviral activity against other coronavirus strains.       Preliminary data support a microbicidal effect of high concentration inhaled NO. We       hypothesize that high concentration inhaled NO can have a viricidal effect against SARS-Cov-2       and prevent the deterioration to a severe form of COVID-19 when administered at an early       stage of the disease. Additional potential mechanisms why INO may be effective in this       indication: 1)improves V/Q ratio, 2) reduces PVR and PAP, 3) Anti-thrombotic in lung. This       would have potential benefit for the patients in terms of reducing the severity of the       clinical course and time to recovery. An additional benefit could be for the society since a       faster and a less severe clinical course could protect limited hospital resources (ED, floor,       and ICU) from being overwhelmed.

The plasma is donated by       an individual that has recovered from the very same infection that another person is infected       with. This plasma is enriched in the antibodies that recognize and helped the body''s immune       system fight off the infection. When transfused from donor to recipient those antibodies will       aid the recipient in fighting off the infection. In recent history this has been used to       fight Ebola. Recently, the Federal Food and Drug Agency (FDA) made possible expedited       Investigational New Drug (IND) process for plasma use in the fight against COVID19 for       emergency and lifesaving uses.       There are several other investigational drugs for treatment of COVID19 such as: Remdesivir,       an antiviral. The off-label use of hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/ritonavir, or Tocilizumab       have been authorized. Convalescent plasma mechanism of action helps to promote health by       working with one''s own immune system and will not interfere with the other proposed       medications. It also will not weaken the immune system as the investigational and off label       medications have the potential to do. Convalescent plasma is time honored and although       investigational for each use against novel or rare infections, it is the basis for IgG       infusions in the immunodeficient populations. Currently the use of IgG infusions such as       Intravenous IgG (IVIG) is assumed to not have the right antibodies from donors in the general       public. This is secondary to the novel nature of the COVID19 and the fact that the IVIG       available today was collected 6 to 12 months ago from plasma donors; prior to the COVID19''s       outbreak discovery in China.       It is for that reason that IVIG is not recommended at this time and the FDA has made special       fast-tracking announcements for plasma use for COVID19. Currently, plasma is the only       treatment that has a previous history of success in these novel or rare viral outbreak       situations. It has already been reported to have been associated with survival of 5 out of 5       participants in a pilot study in China       For the purpose of this study advanced respiratory support will include any measure of       respiratory support above low flow nasal cannula oxygen (2 Liters/minute flow rate).       For the purpose of this study dyspnea will be defined as any shortness of breath that is not       completely relieved with the use of low flow nasal canula oxygen set to 2 Liters/minute flow       rate and/or requiring breathing treatments such as but not limited to: bronchodilators more       than every 4 hours to relieve symptoms.       In the event that more than one recipient is identified and plasma is available in less than       the total number of approved recipients, priority will be given to those approved by the FDA       for the IND use of plasma for severe or critical condition. If there still exists a deficit       of plasma, the priority will be given to those on advanced respiratory support with the most       critical settings (if unclear then will be considered a tie); active pressor treatments; age       <1 years of age with days of life, age adjusted for prematurity as a tie breaker; age >60       with years as a tie breaker; and lastly lottery pull with potential remaining recipients as       the final tie breaker.

COVID-19 is a rapidly evolving pandemic with numerous prediction models       suggesting potential shortages in ventilators, ICU beds, and high rates of hospital       mortality. Case-series suggest sepsis and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are       driving hospitalizations, morbidity (ICU beds, ventilator use, organ failures), and       mortality. A therapy is urgently needed to be given early in the disease course in order to       attenuate the infectious and inflammatory process, reduce risk of intubation, and reduce       progression of organ failure and ARDS. By administering HDIVC at the first objective sign of       worsening oxygenation, documented by change in peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2)       to fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio (S/F) or decreased SpO2 at baseline (mild hypoxia       group), HDIVC may reduce the inflammatory process and development of respiratory failure       requiring intubation. We will also enroll patients already in respiratory failure on       ventilators (severe hypoxia group) and document safety and tolerability in both cohorts. By       calculating ventilator and ICU-free days, we can potentially signal clinically relevant       endpoints that could be used in larger trials needed to answer a crucial therapeutic       question-can early administration of HDIVC in COVID-19 lead to faster recovery or improve       outcomes? Moreover, we will document change in inflammatory markers that are elevated in       COVID-19 (d-dimer, CRP, LDH, liver enzymes, and ferritin) to develop a mechanistic       understanding and risk stratification of response to HDIVC infusion. Ultimately, if HDIVC is       deemed safe and tolerable in hospitalized COVID-19 subjects, a larger clinical trial will be       indicated. AVoCaDO will produce safety and tolerability data to test HDIVC in a multi-center,       rapid, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of subjects with COVID-19.     ","       Previous research has shown that high dose intravenous vitamin C (HDIVC) may benefit patients       with sepsis, acute lung injury (ALI), and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).       However, it is not known if early administration of HDIVC could prevent progression to ARDS.       We hypothesize that HDIVC is safe and tolerable in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)       subjects given early or late in the disease course and may reduce the risk of respiratory       failure requiring mechanical ventilation and development of ARDS along with reductions in       supplemental oxygen demand and inflammatory markers.

","       Background:       COVID-19 is a worldwide pandemic and currently there is no effective therapy or vaccine.       SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the COVID-19 respiratory infection, appears to be very       contagious however all the modes of transmission are unclear. Transmission may occur in up to       25 percent of cases when there are no symptoms (asymptomatic). Before there are any symptoms,       droplet spray during speaking may increase transmission from person to person; most of the       spray is saliva. Researchers at the NIH would like to test saliva for the virus before       symptoms are reported. Additionally, they would like to examine the importance of using masks       to prevent transmission. They hope to better understand how COVID-19 is spread among people       and how it can be prevented.       Objectives:       To determine if the SARS-CoV-2 virus is present in saliva in asymptomatic individuals who are       COVID-19 positive.       To determine if using masks can prevent transmission.       Eligibility:       People ages 18 and older without symptoms of COVID-19 who have been in close contact (e.g.       live in the same house) with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 or NIH workers who       have tested positive for COVID-19 and have mild or no symptoms. Retested individuals may be       enrolled to understand how the disease has progressed and resolved.       Design and Procedures:       For screening, interested participants will contact a study team member. The interested       participant will be asked to provide documentation of COVID-19 positive status, their       symptoms, or their contact to a COVID-19 positive person.       Participants will have weekly telephone calls to discuss their symptoms and 2-5 drive-up       visits to the NIH within 28 days.       At the drive-up facility, participants will participate in a speaking exercise with and       without wearing a mask. The droplets they produce while they speak will be collected.       Participants will spit into a cup and have saliva collected from different areas of the       mouth. They should not eat 90 minutes before this but drinking water or juice is acceptable.       They may have their tongue painted with a sour liquid to increase their saliva. Participants       will have a swab rubbed inside their nose. For those who are close contacts and need a       COVID-19 test, they will have a swab inserted through the nose to rub the back of their       throat.       Participants will complete questionnaires about their symptoms electronically at home.       Subjects may be asked to return to the NIH more frequently by the study team based on testing       results.       If at any time the participants start to have moderate or severe respiratory symptoms, their       participation will end and they should seek care with their local provider.

NCT04393155,2020-04-16,Recruiting,,Observational,Longitudinal COVID-19 Cohort Study,"Inflammatory, Pulmonary, Physical & Neuropsychological Sequelae of COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Failure: A 1-Year Longitudinal Study",Acute Respiratory Failure|COVID-19,COVID-19+ observational,All,18,,No,05405,,,,Cohort,,"       The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and associated COVID-19 illness has quickly spread       worldwide, with substantial morbidity and mortality. Early data suggest that most patients       with severe COVID-19 (i.e., experiencing acute respiratory failure (ARF) in an intensive care       unit) may have cytokine release syndrome and other major effects on the innate and adaptive       immune systems. However, there is limited understanding of both the       inflammatory/immunological and the clinical course of COVID-19, with no robust data published       beyond hospital discharge. Based on prior literature from acute viral illnesses, such as       Ebola and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), persistent functional impairments in       COVID-19 survivors is expected. Despite the importance of these issues, very few studies have       ever investigated the biological mechanisms underlying persistent functional impairments       after ARF. Hence, understanding the short- and longer-term biological and clinical outcomes       of patients with COVID-19, and investigating associations between inflammation and clinical       outcomes is important to design acute therapies and recovery-focused interventions.       To address critical gaps in knowledge, the investigators propose a 2-center longitudinal       cohort study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients via an Administrative Supplement to our       existing grant (R01HL132887, MPIs Stapleton and Needham). Investigators will study COVID-19       patients with ARF who have either severe disease (requiring mechanical ventilation,       non-invasive ventilation, or high flow nasal cannula oxygen support) or non-severe disease       (new or increased supplemental oxygen requirement, without meeting severe criteria).       Researchers will perform an in-depth evaluation of inflammatory/immunological, physical,       pulmonary, and neuropsychological status during hospitalization, and over 3, 6, and 12-month       follow-up. Feasibility for accomplishing this prospective study is demonstrated by 1) a       successful existing collaboration between the University of Vermont (UVM) and Johns Hopkins       University (JHU), supported by multiple NIH grants, and 2) the current and projected COVID-19       census at both hospital systems. The investigators have the existing infrastructure,       expertise, and personnel to enroll 225 patients with COVID-19, and longitudinally follow       survivors for 12 months, to investigate short-term and longer-term inflammatory/immunologic       and clinical outcomes during this pandemic.     ","       The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus has quickly spread worldwide, with substantial morbidity and       mortality. There is very limited understanding of the short- and longer-term       inflammatory/immunological and clinical course. However, the investigators expect survivors       from severe COVID-19 to experience persistent functional impairments, as demonstrated in       prior studies of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other acute       viral illnesses. Notably, however, few studies have ever investigated the biologic mechanisms       underlying these functional impairments. Understanding these features of COVID-19 will       improve the ability to design acute therapies and recovery-focused interventions. To address       these knowledge gaps, the investigators propose a two-center, 225 patient longitudinal       prospective cohort study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure.       Researchers will perform an in-depth evaluation of inflammatory/immunological biomarkers, and       physical, pulmonary, and neuropsychological clinical outcomes during hospitalization, and       over 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up.

This is a prospective, point prevalence study. Data collection will occur       once a week during the months of April through June 2020.       The protocol for the point prevalence is for each individual participating site to conduct a       surveillance study on predetermined dates of their intensive care units (pediatric medical,       surgical, cardiac ICUs) for patients by the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study is       strictly observational. Data will only be captured on the predetermined dates listed. The       dates have been chosen to reflect the estimated surge and peak of the virus spread in North       America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. The rationale for performing an urgent point       prevalence estimation study first, includes the following: a) there is almost no knowledge on       AKI rate, severity of AKI or how current pandemic-setting AKI phenotype differs from what we       know of AKI in children prior to the pandemic. A rapidly-performed, high feasibility-designed       point prevalence estimation study, with minimal data collection will provide rapid, almost       instantaneous dissemination of results to the international community. Based on the results       of this study, a follow-up study is planned for a full retrospective data collection of all       viral positive patients.

","       This study is an observational registry of children with or suspected to have SARS CoV2       (COVID-19) admitted to pediatric intensive care units (PICU). This registry will help       describe the prevalence, rate and severity of acute kidney injury (AKI) in children with       Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2(SARS CoV2) across the world. The registry       will be developed using a point prevalence methodology and then full retrospective review.       Once a week, from April through June 2020, data collection will occur in real-time to       estimate a weekly point prevalence of AKI and renal replacement therapy (RRT). The       operational definition of patients under investigation (PUIs) will be used to identify the       denominator of patients to be studied. The PUIs will be cohorted into SARS CoV2 test       positive, test negative, test pending, or test unavailable.

Hydroxychloroquine has demonstrated potent       inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin together have       significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral carriage over 6 days compared to a placebo and       COVID-19 patients who received a 5 day regimen of 400mg/day of Hydroxychloroquine had       significantly shortened times to clinical recovery characterized by improved pneumonia       compared with patients who did not receive Hydroxychloroquine.       Within OSF Healthcare approximately 50% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are currently       receiving some form of Hydroxychloroquine during the course of their hospitalization. The       utilization of this treatment has been approved by the FDA based upon the limited data       available.       Significance:       The optimal treatment regimen for COVID-19 patients has yet to be defined. Several small       studies have indicated a potential role for the utilization of Hydroxychloroquine in the       treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. However, very little evidence exists around the       optimal treatment regimen and efficacy with regard to tangible outcomes. This observational       retrospective/prospective chart review study aims to help provide epidemiological data that       may help to provide guidance to clinicians for both future patients, as well as provide       clinicians guidance for study design of more definitive controlled studies. Given the rapid       spread of this disease, the high mortality rate associated with it and the impact of the       disease upon society this study is anticipated to have the potential to contribute       significantly to the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.       Study Design and Methodology:       The study will be a retrospective/prospective observational study of cohorts of hospitalized       patients across the OSF Healthcare System who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and exhibit       signs or symptoms of respiratory distress during the course of their hospitalization. The       outcomes of patients who both receive and do not receive Hydroxychloroquine will be compared,       with particular attention to the timing of administration in relationship to the onset of       respiratory distress. Respiratory distress will be defined as a low SpO2, an elevated       respiratory rate or an increased oxygen demand. Hydroxychloroquine administration will be       defined as a documented administration of the medication on the patient''s medication       administration record (MAR). Administration of Hydroxychloroquine prior to the onset of       respiratory distress, administration of Hydroxychloroquine on the day of respiratory distress       and administration of Hydroxychloroquine following the onset of respiratory distress will all       be assessed and compared across three outcome metrics; progression to an ICU location of       care, progression to ventilator support and mortality.         -  Patients at all OSF HealthCare locations across the Ministry that meet            Inclusion/Exclusion criteria will be cohorted by:              -  Hydroxychloroquine administered - yes (including the date started)              -  Hydroxychloroquine - no         -  For the Hydroxychloroquine administered - yes cohort, further subdivide into 3 cohorts:              -  Hydroxychloroquine date started was before the date recorded for signs of                 respiratory distress              -  Hydroxychloroquine date started was the same as the date recorded for signs of                 respiratory distress              -  Hydroxychloroquine date started was after the date recorded for signs of                 respiratory distress         -  At this point the investigators would have 4 cohorts:              -  Hydroxychloroquine - No              -  Hydroxychloroquine date started was before the date recorded for signs of                 respiratory distress              -  Hydroxychloroquine date started was the same as the date recorded for signs of                 respiratory distress              -  Hydroxychloroquine date started was after the date recorded for signs of                 respiratory distress         -  These 4 cohorts would be compared to determine any difference in the following metrics:              -  Mortality              -  ICU Admissions              -  Ventilator use         -  Additional study of additional treatment regimens using a similar design may be repeated            for the following treatments              -  Hydroxychloroquine + Azithromycin              -  Remdesivir (This is a compassionate use medication with very limited use in OSF.

Privacy and Confidentiality:       Study staff will maintain the highest degree of confidentiality permitted for clinical and       research information obtained from the participants. Medical and records will be maintained       in the strictest confidence. However, as a part of the quality assurance and legal       responsibilities of an investigation, the clinical site must permit monitoring       representatives of various governing facilities to examine clinical records for the purpose       of quality assurance reviews, audits, and evaluations of the registry safety and progress.       Unless required by the laws that permit copying of records, only the coded identity       associated with documents or with other participant data may be copied (and all personally       identifying information must be obscured). Authorized representatives as noted above are       bound to maintain the strict confidentiality of medical and research information that is       linked to individuals. The clinical site will normally be notified before auditing visits       occur.       Risks:       The main risk in this study is the potential breach of privacy and loss of confidentiality.       There is minimal risk of likelihood of harm. All reasonable safeguards to secure the       confidentiality of information will be taken by the investigators and their research       personnel.

There is a more than 50       years track record of safety of HCQ for treatment and prevention of various disease states.       Early data on use of HCQ for COVID treatment suggests anti-viral activity and       immunomodulatory properties for reducing inflammation associated with COVID-19. Given the       lack of data regarding use of HCQ for COVID-19 prevention in healthy participants in midst of       pandemic crisis, this study proposes an expedited feasibility study focusing on safety and       early efficacy.       Prior to HCQ administration, baseline SARS-CoV-2 and other baseline biomarker testing will be       conducted. During the 4-week study period, participants will be monitored for drug related       adverse events and assessed for development of COVID. SARS-CoV-2 assay and biomarker testing       will be repeated at the end of four-week study. Safety outcomes will be assessed by the       number of adverse events (AEs) and their severity; and early efficacy as the number of       participants who tested positive at the end of the 4-week period comparing to data collected       by occupational Health regarding the total number of high-risk healthcare workers that were       tested positive during the same period and historical controls from known high risk infection       rates.

The broader aim of this study is to set a precedent to facilitate a large-scale emergent       public health intervention. Purpose would be to mitigate, or abort further transmission of       COVID-19. Given that COVID-19 transmission has occurred prior to initiation of this study,       the rationale for this intervention is based on prior epidemiological evidence.       Post-infectious or vaccination-induced immunity in at least 30% of population at-risk has       been shown to mitigate or abort propagation of a local epidemics and global pandemic. This       would help flatten the curve of the disease progression, until such time that a vaccine may       become available.

The COVID-19 public       health crisis requires the full resources and attention of healthcare systems. This has led       to several healthcare changes that affect obstetrics and gynecology patients, including       delays and cancellations in elective surgery, visitor restrictions, and transitioning from in       person outpatient visits to telemedicine visits. The American College of Obstetricians and       Gynecologists (ACOG) joined with several other OB/Gyn societies to announce their joint       statement on March 16th, 2020 to reduce the number of elective surgeries in OB/Gyn to free up       healthcare resources. Hospitals and outpatient clinics are instituting visitor restrictions.       Specifically, at Banner University Medical Center - Phoenix (BUMCP), they are not allowing       any visitors with the exception of one visitor for an obstetric laboring patient or for       pediatric patients. All non-essential OB and Gyn visits are transitioning to telemedicine       visits through the telephone or video conferencing platforms, with the exception of obstetric       visits that require labs, vitals, or fetal assessments.       These healthcare changes to OB/Gyn patients is likely impacting their level of stress.       Evidence-based interventions for stress include cognitive behavior therapy, although this can       be time consuming, requires the need for specialized providers, and is not feasible for all       patients during this COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmacotherapy can be used, including       antidepressants and anxiolytics, however they have inherent limitations such as side effects,       tolerance, and interactions that limit their use. Consumer based mobile applications (apps)       may help individuals with self-management strategies for stress (1). Mindfulness meditation       is one type of self-management strategy and is the practice of moment-to-moment awareness in       which the person purposefully focuses on the present without judgement (1,2).       Calm is a mindfulness meditation mobile app that offers a range of mindfulness meditation       practice guide modules that vary in length, instruction, and content. The app includes       meditation lessons, sleep stories (bed-time stories for grown-ups), sleep music, and nature       sounds. Few studies on the use of Calm exist and include a randomized controlled trial       evaluating its affect to decrease stress among college students and a descriptive study       evaluating cancer patient''s perceptions of the app (1,3). There is limited literature on the       effects of mindfulness meditation in obstetrics and gynecology and include its effects on       postoperative pain, infertility, and painful bladder (4-6). During these unprecedented times       of the COVID-19 pandemic, mindfulness meditation mobile apps such as Calm may be potentially       beneficial to help with stress in OB/Gyn patients, although this requires further       investigation.       The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of the mindfulness meditation app Calm       on stress, anxiety, and sleep in outpatient obstetrics and gynecology patients during the       COVID-19 pandemic. Participants will be randomized to two groups; Arm 1 receives a 30 day       free trial at the start of the study, Arm 2 receives a 30 day free trial at the conclusion of       the study. All participants will complete a baseline survey on perceived stress, anxiety, and       sleep at the start of the study, again at 2 weeks into the study, and again one month later.       The investigator''s primary objective is to evaluate perceived stress (validated Perceived       Stress Scale) with use of the mindfulness meditation app, Calm, among outpatient OB/Gyn       patients during COVID-19 pandemic. The investigator''s secondary objectives are to evaluate       anxiety (validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and sleep (validated PROMIS Sleep       Disturbance Short Form) with use of the mindfulness meditation app, Calm, among outpatient       OB/Gyn patients during COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the investigators want to assess       feasibility with using the app which includes measurements of adherence and participant       satisfaction with use of the app.     ","       Due to the COVID-19 global health pandemic, many people are likely experiencing increased       stress. Many obstetrics and gynecology patients are additionally experiencing increased       stress due to the healthcare changes the COVID-19 pandemic has caused including delayed or       canceled elective surgeries, visitor restrictions, and telemedicine visits instead of in       person clinic visits. Mindfulness meditation is a self-management strategy that can be       utilized by anyone to assist with the management of stress. Mindfulness meditation mobile       applications, such as the Calm app, can be used to help manage stress, especially during       this uncertain time. The investigators propose a prospective randomized controlled trial       evaluating perceived stress, anxiety, and sleep disturbance in the investigators outpatient       OB/Gyn patients at Banner Women''s Institute, with the use of a 30 day trial of the       mindfulness meditation app, Calm. All patients would ultimately receive a 30 day free trial       of the mobile meditation app, however the intervention group would receive the 30-day free       trial immediately and the control group would receive the 30-day free trial after the study       period which is 30 days after enrollment.

Aims/Objectives            The effectiveness of blockade of IL-6R in treating patients with COVID-19 disease of            moderate severity will be tested in a pragmatic and adaptive randomized trial. The            primary outcome is intubation or death within 14 days of enrollment OR administration of            a rescue dose of IL-6 inhibition if the patient is do-not-resuscitate            (DNR)/do-not-intubate (DNI) and the primary team determines it is appropriate based on            clinical deterioration. Secondary outcomes include time to hospital discharge if alive,            time to clinical recovery as was defined in a recent study, ICU length of stay, time to            return to normal or baseline oxygen saturation, and changes in laboratory biomarkers.         2. Background Information            SARS-COV-2 is a novel human pathogen that emerged at the end of 2019 and rapidly spread            worldwide. Clinical disease caused by this novel infection has a high mortality rate,            particularly in older adults and in patients with underlying cardiopulmonary disease,            populations that are highly prevalent within the VA healthcare system. This creates an            urgent need for the VA to quickly and efficiently identify effective therapies to reduce            mortality and spread of the disease. Based on in vitro and in vivo data, potential            treatment options include anti-viral drugs (such as antimalarials or medications            originally developed to treat HIV infection (e.g., lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir)),            anti-inflammatory drugs, including IL-6 inhibition, and innovations in supportive care,            such as placing patients in prone positioning while awake and not intubated.            Importantly, in the context of the global pandemic and exponential spread of the            disease, clinical trials must be designed in a manner that 1) optimizes outcomes for            Veterans, and 2) produces rapid answers, so that effective treatments can be deployed            quickly to reduce unnecessary deaths. Based on a review of 384 ongoing clinical trials            by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, and a daily search of open clinical trials,            many conventional controlled clinical trials of antiviral drugs and cytokine-blocking            drugs are in progress and are likely to be completed within a few months; however, it is            possible that these trials, which may take months to implement and report results, will            not yield any information about how to treat patients until after the peak of the            pandemic is over. A secondary challenge is that it is important to identify what works            and what does not work quickly, so that manufacturers can understand what medications            need to be produced so that supply chains are adequate for treating all patients who            might benefit from an intervention. Thus, innovative clinical trial methodologies are            needed in order to produce answers in a highly compressed time frame to inform medical            decision-making and supply chain management.            This novel and innovative proposal concerns use and comparison an existing drug            (sarilumab) that blocks the receptor for the inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Most studies of            IL-6 pathway blockade are using IV medications and include restrictive eligibility            criteria and are directed towards patients with severe disease. The investigators            hypothesize that patients earlier in the disease course - prior to severe respiratory            decompensation - might benefit the most from IL-6 inhibition, and thus are the            population included in this pragmatic trial. This study will expand our knowledge and            understanding about how IL-6 inhibition can be used to prevent disease progression in            patients with moderate disease. It will use a more readily available subcutaneous,            longer-acting formulation directed towards patients with moderate disease, of whom            25-35% can progress to severe disease, often rapidly. Eligibility criteria allow for a            broad range of underlying choices of other medications, including antiviral medications            such as remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine, among others, baseline laboratory values, and            comorbidities, reflecting likely real-world clinical use. Thus, this pragmatic project            would fill a major gap in research about the clinical care of patients with COVID-19.            Release of preliminary results to the popular press already necessitated revision of            this protocol after only 9 subjects had been enrolled. Interim analysis of a study of            sarilumab by its manufacturer has led to revision of the study population and treatment            arms. Originally, two doses (200 mg and 400 mg) were tested, and patients with either            severe (oxygen requirement and other poor prognostic features) or critical (mechanical            ventilation) disease were included. Interim analysis indicated benefit only with 400 mg            in critical disease, so that will be the design of the remainder of that trial. In            contrast, a study of of a relatively high dose of tocilizumab (8 mg/kg) was reported to            be beneficial in a controlled trial of patients varying in severity from critical            illness to merely requiring supplementary oxygen. In response, the current study has            been modified to allow routine escalation of dosing among a broad range of moderate            severity short of critical illness. For patients who are critically ill, it is expected            that off-label use of a wide range of heroic therapies will be tried, including but            not limited to cytokine blocking therapies, so exclusion of such patients from this            trial does not limit the therapeutic options for such patients, and from a research            perspective, such patients have become the focus of the largest ongoing study of            sarilumab.         3. Rationale and Purpose            Severe COVID-19 disease is characterized by a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome            (ARDS) followed by a severe cardiomyopathy in many cases. Based on currently available            data, it is unclear how much of the respiratory damage in COVID-19 is due to direct            effects of SARS-COV-2, or if the primary driver of severe disease is the inflammatory            response generated in response to the virus. The key role of inflammation in the            progression of the disease is highlighted by recent studies, which demonstrate that            patients who progress to requiring ICU-level care no longer have detectable virus            present in their respiratory tract. Thus, identifying drugs that could dampen the            inflammatory response prior to severe clinical decompensation without adversely            affecting clearance of virus would be clinically useful and lead to improved outcomes.            Elevated biomarkers of severe inflammation (such as IL-6, CRP, ferritin, and            lymphopenia) have been strongly associated with severe disease and increased mortality            in patients with COVID-19, and early development of a strong IgG response may            paradoxically be a poor prognostic sign during the acute phase of the disease. In            contrast, viral load in upper respiratory secretions at baseline is only modestly            associated with clinical outcomes, and viral load declines in most patients after            presentation, independent of the clinical course of the disease. Severe disease            typically arises more than 2 weeks after symptom onset, a time at which virus is usually            no longer detectable. These findings suggest that progression to severe disease may be            driven more by the inflammatory response to the disease than a direct viral effect, and            point to anti-inflammatory drugs as potentially critical therapeutic options.            Importantly, high dose glucocorticoids have been found to be ineffective in severe            COVID-19 and are associated with somewhat worse outcomes, so other more targeted            anti-inflammatory options are urgently needed.            Blockade of IL-6 signaling is a particularly attractive approach. Sarilumab and            tocilizumab are antibodies to the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), FDA-approved for long-term            treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Tocilizumab has been used open-label with enough            anecdotal success in enough patients in China that the manufacturers of sarilumab and            tocilizumab have rapidly opened clinical trials in multiple countries at assess efficacy            in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Tocilizumab has also demonstrated efficacy in            reducing mortality associated with the cytokine release syndrome in patients receiving            CAR-T treatment for cancer, in which the pathogenic pathway is widespread T-cell            activation, which leads to production of pleiotropic inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6            by monocytes. Although trials attempting to rescue patients with severe COVID-19 with            ARDS and/or cardiomyopathy are essential and are in progress, the ideal population for            clinical use may be patients who are not yet critically ill but are at high risk of            clinical deterioration due to secondary inflammation.         4. Relevance to Veterans Health            COVID-19 has a high mortality rate of 2-3% among symptomatic patients. It is expected to            have a particularly high mortality in Veterans, because age >60, underlying            cardiovascular or lung disease, and obesity are significant risk factors for mortality            and clinical deterioration. Thus, advances in care of patients sick enough to be            hospitalized yet prior to intubation are expected to have particular benefit for            Veterans.         5. Study Design       Design. Prospective, randomized, unblinded interventional clinical trial.       Two arms: standard care, based on established practices within the medical center, or       standard care plus subcutaneous sarilumab.       Assignment Strategy: Randomized play-the-winner design, such that randomization becomes       weighted toward the arm that was more effective in previous enrolled subjects. The       probability of randomization to a specific arm (standard of care or standard of care plus       intervention) will be updated based on outcomes in blocks of 10-20 subjects (see Planned       Statistical Analyses). The protocol does not include administration of sarilumab or       tocilizumab as a rescue medication if a patient randomized to standard of care alone       deteriorates to the point that the primary outcome (intubation) is met, or if the patient is       DNR/DNI and the patient''s primary clinical team determines intubation would be performed if       the patient''s goals of care included intubation. Such patients may receive any treatment per       the judgment of their treating physician, and such treatment might include sarilumab or       tocilizumab. Use of sarilumab or tocilizumab in this setting will simply be regarded as a       treatment failure and not as a protocol deviation.       Data will be extracted remotely from the EHR. No data will be generated specifically for       study purposes.     ","       Objectives: To determine whether blockade of IL-6R is beneficial in patients with COVID-19       infection of moderate severity.       Research Design: Randomized, controlled trial. Two-arm trial comparing standard care alone to       standard care with addition of sarilumab (anti-IL6R). The trial will use a randomized       play-the-winner design, in which randomization becomes weighted toward the arm that was more       effective in previous subjects in the trial.       Methodology Hospitalized patients meeting clinical criteria for moderate disease and testing       positive for coronavirus infection. Interventions: sarilumab, 400 mg subcutaneous injection.       Standard care is not pre-specified, may vary among patients, and may include agents with       anti-viral activity, such as remdesivir or hydroxychloroquine, among others. Up to 120       patients, primary outcome intubation or death within 14 days. All data will be extracted       remotely from the electronic health record (EHR).       Clinical Implications: The study has potential to establish IL-6R blockade, delivered       subcutaneously, as standard of care in reducing progression to critical illness in patients       with moderate COVID-19 disease.

Quantitatively calibrates the nuclear camera to guarantee that the measurements made by            the camera are accurate, consistent and reproducible. This quantification is dependent            upon the isotope being used, the camera and the timing sequence of image acquisition.            Such calibration is NOT currently done and it is part of the patent. Studies have            demonstrated that the lack of this quantitative calibration has resulted in up to 1/3 of            the data being lost for SUV and qualitative interpretation; in addition to making            quantification impossible.         2. The patient presents in a fasting state - to eliminate digestive processes from            interfering with blood flow distributions - and the differences in metabolic and            regional blood flow differences (RBFDs) are enhanced with vasodilatory agents, shifting            blood flow and isotope towards regions of greater blood flow and metabolism; enhancing            isotope delivery, uptake and quantification.         3. With a now quantitatively calibrated nuclear camera - in this instance a PLANAR camera -            or SPECT/CT or PET/CT/MRI if specifically approved - to allow imaging to be done at            patient''s bedside reducing the use of hospital resources required for transport and            decrease potential for patient complications resulting from a transport - image            acquisition will occur for 10-minutes following peak enhancement effect of the            vasodilatory agent and timed injection of the isotope based upon the enhancing agent.            Regions-of-interest (ROIs) will drawn by the nuclear technologist - either at the            bedside or in the nuclear laboratory - to provide FMTVDM measurements using software            already present in the nuclear camera systems. Specific ROIs will be drawn of the right            lung (total), left lung (total), mediastinum (thymus activity), and any specific areas            where increased tracer uptake is noted.         4. These FMTVDM measurements including MAXIMAL COUNTS +/- VARIANCE, provide the values of            the most active pulmonary tissue resulting from the CoVid-19 infection and inflammatory            response; just as it has previously been used for CAD and Cancer.         5. From these FMTVDM measurements, the pulmonary tissue and the CoVid-19 infectious process            results are placed on a Health-Spectrum showing where in the tissue transitioning            process the patient is. The measurements also provide information about how rapidly the            tissue is changing. FMTVDM provides the quantitative measurement of where the patient is            at any point in time during their course of treatment and how they compare with other            patients.         6. Once the FMTVDM measurements have been obtained, treatment decisions can be made based            upon serial changes in FMTVDM. Treatments outcomes are based upon FMTVDM measurements,            including the maximum FMTVDM and the variance in those measurements. By comparing serial            FMTVDM results, improvement or deterioration in the patient''s health and the success or            failure of the current treatment regimen is measured, providing patient-centered,            patient-specific, patient-oriented and patient-directed decisions. Thus saving time,            money, resources and lives - not to mention unnecessary side effects from treatment,            which is not working.     ","       Diagnostic determination of disease and treatment responses has been limited to qualitative       imaging, measurement of serum markers of disease, and sampling of tissue. In each of these       instances, there is a built in error either due to sensitivity and specificity issues,       clinician interpretation of results, or acceptance of the use of an indirect marker (blood       test) of what is happening elsewhere in the body - at the tissue level.       The Fleming Method for Tissue and Vascular Differentiation and Metabolism (FMTVDM) using same       state single or sequential quantification comparisons [1] provides the first and only       patented test (#9566037) - along with the associated submitted patent applications ruled to       be covered under #9566037 - that quantitatively measures changes in tissue resulting from       inter alia a disease process. This includes inter alia coronary artery disease (CAD), cancer       and infectious/inflammatory processes including CoVid-19 pneumonia (CVP) resulting from the       metabolic and regional blood flow differences (RBFDs) caused by these diseases.       The purpose of this paper is to make clinicians and researchers aware of this proposed method       for investigating the prevalence and severity of CVP - in addition to providing rapid       determination of treatment response in each patient, directing treatment decisions; thereby       reducing the loss of time, money, resources and patient lives.

In the first 3 weeks of the       COVID-19 pandemic within Michigan over 3300 patients tested positive through our system and       over 1000 have been admitted for inpatient care. COVID-19 has a wide range of presentations       from asymptomatic to multisystem organ failure and death. Spread from asymptomatic       individuals has been described in the literature but the extent of this transmission is       unclear. Large scale serologic testing can help address this question by detecting antibodies       generated after an individual is infected with COVID-19. Healthcare workers have developed       COVID-19 but the true infection rate among those who care for COVID-19 patients and whether       the infection occurs at work is unknown.       Every day, thousands of Beaumont physicians, nurses, technicians and other caregivers are       working under extraordinary stress, doing their very best to care for patients with this       highly contagious and potentially deadly virus. They are trying to protect themselves from       infection while dealing with personal protective equipment requirements and limited knowledge       of who in the hospital environment may be carrying the infection and potentially spreading it       among the staff. Caregivers are at greater risk of infection than the public, and when they       become sick, it reduces the number of trained personnel available to care for hospitalized       patients. Serological testing would give Beaumont''s front-line staff, family members and       patients peace of mind by determining infection rates in our care units. Knowing the       infection rates will demonstrate how effective the use of personal protective equipment has       been for staff, whether any flaws exist in the system, and how many clinical staff currently       have potentially protective antibodies.       Beaumont Health has 2 EURO Lab Workstations capable of running the SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA       EUROIMMUN serology assay (referred to as the EUROIMMUN assay hereafter). Each EUROIMMUN assay       consists of 2 separate tests; one of which measures IgG (the memory antibody which should       give long acting resistance to people who mount an immune response) and the second of which       measures IgA (the secretory antibody that should protect against infection through mucous       membranes). Researchers can run 5,000 samples a day with each sample being tested for IgA and       IgG.       Potential participants (employees and affiliated non-employed physicians and advanced       practice providers) will provide informed consent. Researchers will analyze all participants       over 2 blood draws between 2 and 4 weeks apart to see if they developed antibodies to       COVID-19. Participants at medium risk for exposure in their job function at Beaumont will       have 3 draws 2-4 weeks apart and people considered the highest risk, those who provide the       direct patient care to COVID-19 patients, will be tested 2-4 weeks apart until the pandemic       in Michigan is under control (estimated to be 8 blood draws). If the participants agree,       researchers will bank 0.5 ml of serum for future testing related to COVID-19. An initial       questionnaire and subsequent questionnaires with each blood draw will be completed by       participants. Biostatistics will analyze the data from the questionnaires and the serology       test to determine any links between level of risk associated with the participants job,       medical history, and exposure history to development of COVID-19 antibodies. Participants       medical records will be monitored for one year to see if they are diagnosed with COVID-19 and       if they have a positive PCR test for COVID-19 since they were tested for the presence of       antibodies. All employees identified as developing COVID-19 after their antibody levels were       tested will be analyzed and a correlation between antibody level and development of COVID-19       will be generated. This will allow an estimation of the protective effect of antibodies       relative to people who have no detectable antibodies. Researchers will perform an       epidemiologic analysis to identify contacts between staff and patients based on records in       the EMR and can cross reference to determine if nosocomial transmission is likely occurring       from staff to patients and vice versa. Researchers will also determine if there was any       likely exposure to patients with COVID-19 on the same floor or if prior patients in the room       had COVID-19. This will also allow researchers to model the rate of spread of the virus       within the hospital from unknown sources.       Additional studies on subpopulations of participants will test whether antibody tests on       dried blood spots (small drops of blood applied to filter paper, which do not have to be       refrigerated) correlate with results obtained from drawing a full vial of blood.       Reproducibility, stability, the effect of shipping, inter-lab concordance and any differences       between participant-collected and phlebotomist-collected blood spot samples will be tested.       An additional subpopulation study will test immediate family members of participants who test       positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to evaluate intra-family spread of the disease. Another       subpopulation study will recruit participants from other high-risk populations at the       discretion of the investigators.     ","       The purpose of this study is to determine how peoples'' bodies respond to exposure to       COVID-19. Employees of Beaumont Health in Michigan who are older than 18 years may be       eligible to participate. Participants from other high-risk groups who are not Beaumont       employees may also be recruited, as may family members of Beaumont employees who have tested       positive for COVID-19. Participants will have blood drawn two or more times for serology       testing. This serology test will determine if participants have detectable levels of the       antibodies that our bodies develop to fight COVID-19 infection. Participants will fill out a       questionnaire each time they provide a blood sample. The questionnaires include questions       about participants'' personal traits; their health; general questions about their risk to       exposure; job and risk of exposure; symptoms, diagnosis, treatment of COVID-19 since last       blood draw. Researchers will monitor participants'' medical records in a confidential manner       for one year after the last blood draw to help determine if people who develop antibodies to       COVID-19 are protected against developing a COVID-19 infection in the future.There may be no       direct benefits for participants; however, information from this study may benefit other       people by increasing our understanding of COVID-19, how it spreads from person to person, and       how people respond to fight off the infection.The results of the serology test are used for       research only and will not affect clinical decisions regarding participants'' treatment or       quarantine     ","Number of participants testing positive for the presence of IgG or IgA antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using the EUROIMMUN Serology testing platform.

All participants will provide a minimum of 2 blood draws between 2 and 4 weeks apart to determine the presence of antibodies to COVID-19.

Food insecurity in a family is detrimental to a child''s mental and physical health,       and poses a risk to his/her development. Food insecurity prevalence has also been reported       higher than the state level prevalence in households impacted by disasters. It is therefore       reasonable to hypothesize that the unprecedented global COVID-19 pandemic has increased the       frequency of food insecurity among lower income families. However, no data are known about       the current incidence of food insecurity during a pandemic with quarantine procedures in       place. This knowledge will also add background for future studies on the effects of acute on       chronic food insecurity on low-income families facing similar adversities such as this       epidemic.       A 2-question tool has been validated to evaluate the presence of food insecurity. An       affirmative response to either question has been reported to yield a sensitivity of 97% and       specificity of 83-86%. Screening for basic needs may open a sensitive discussion about       economic difficulties associated with the adverse health outcomes previously discussed. While       this tool is a current standard of care as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics,       it is often not utilized in medical visits to a primary care provider whether for routine       well child care or for sick visits. During the study period, pediatricians at two FQHC       clinics will make a concentrated effort to ask these 2 screening questions in order to       collect data on the prevalence and magnitude of challenges of food insecurity at this time.       Although the investigators are seeking to evaluate the current standard of care, they may       want to share our findings in order to provide a foundation for more generalizable research.       The investigators will seek to take a random sampling of 500 pediatric patients (250 each       from 2 CommUnity Care clinics) and query the parent/guardian with the 2-question food       insecurity tool during their regular appointment, either in person or on the       phone/telehealth. The pediatricians (Co-Inv) will ask the questions and record the data.       2-questions to assess food insecurity as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics:         1. We worried whether our food would run out before we got money to buy more. Was that            often true, sometimes true, or never true for your household in the last 12 months?         2. The food we bought just didn''t last, and we didn''t have money to get more. Was that            often true, sometimes true, or never true for your household in the last 12 months? A            response of often true or sometimes true to either question = positive screen for            Food Insecurity.       The investigators will also ask the same 2 questions in the framework of …in the last 1-2       months to assess how the current situation has affected their immediate concerns. If the       parent/guardian response with a positive screen for food insecurity, the pediatrician will       refer the families to available community resources as is the usual standard of care.       The investigators will not record any identifiable information. This is not a longitudinal       study. In 4-6 months the investigators will repeat this procedure with another, different       random sampling of 500 patients to assess any long lasting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic       or to determine if the immediate food crisis due to the pandemic has passed. The       investigators requested a waiver of consent for this project.     ",       The investigators suspect that the current COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with a high       level of unsuspected food insecurity among lower income Austin families who receive their       health care at a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC).

INTRODUCTION, RATIONALE The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, in late       2019 and has quickly become a pandemic, significantly impacting the health and economy of the       United States and the rest of the world. There are over 500,000 cases and 24,000 deaths       related to COVID-19 worldwide, with an estimated mortality rate ranging from 1-8%. The United       States has been impacted by this pandemic significantly with over 80,000 cases and thousands       of deaths reported; these numbers will continue to worsen.       Patients infected with COVID-19 can exhibit a wide range of clinical manifestations, ranging       from an asymptomatic state to mild upper respiratory symptoms (with low-grade fever) to       severe disease with hypoxia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) type lung injury.       In the setting of hypoxemic respiratory failure, ground glass opacification on chest imaging       is found more than 50% of the time.       COVID-19 has the potential to cause myocardial injury with at least 17% found to have an       elevated troponin and 23% noted to have heart failure in a study of 191 inpatients from       Wuhan, China. The prevalence of heart failure was significantly higher among non-survivors       compared with survivors (52% vs. 12%). In a meta-analysis of 4 studies including a total of       341 patients, standardized mean difference of cardiac troponin I levels were significantly       higher in those with severe COVID-19 related illness compared to those with non-severe       disease (25.6, 95% CI 6.8-44.5). Furthermore, cases of fulminant myocarditis with cardiogenic       shock have also been reported, with associated atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. In a       recent report from Wuhan, China, 16.7% of hospitalized and 44.4% of ICU patients with       COVID-19 had cardiac arrhythmias. Given the potential sampling bias in sicker, hospitalized       patients with hypoxia and electrolyte abnormalities in the acute phase of severe illness can       potentiate cardiac arrhythmias, the exact arrhythmic risk related to COVID-19 in patients       with less severe illness or those who recover from the acute phase of the severe illness is       currently unknown.       Furthermore, as it is currently unclear what medications may be beneficial for patients with       COVID-19. Several medications eg: chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, tocilizumab       etc. are currently being investigated. Hydroxychloroquine is known to block Kv11.1 (HERG) and       can cause drug-induced LQT. As such, these drugs are used concomitantly with other       antiarrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone, Tikosyn, sotalol etc. which can be associated with       QT prolongation requiring close EKG and cardiac monitoring. Improved characterization of       arrhythmia burden and mechanism of death is critical, primarily in guiding the need for       developing treatment strategies, additional arrhythmia monitoring and need to consider       advanced prevention strategies including the role of implantable cardioverter defibrillator       (ICD).     ","       The objective of the study is to estimate the frequency of cardiac arrhythmias and       characterize the mode of death in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19).       This is a single-center, retrospective/ prospective registry enrolling all COVID-19 positive       patients at Mount Sinai Hospital.

Povidone-iodine has been shown to have virucidal properties against multiple viruses       including against the virus that causes SARS which is very similar in makeup to the virus       causing COVID-19.       The investigators hypothesize that 4x daily use of oral gargles and nasal rinses using a       povidone iodine solution will help to reduce the viral load in the nasopharynx and oropharynx       in patients who are COVID-19+. If this hypothesis is shown to be true this could potentially       have an impact on time to recovery of clinical symptoms as well as reduce shedding of the       virus by infected patients. A time course of 7 days was chosen in order to recognize a trend       in the viral load over time for patients receiving each of the interventions. Chlorhexidine       gluconate and saline rinses were chosen as additional treatment arms as these are frequently       used for oral and nasal hygiene and their role in affecting viral load is currently unknown.     ,"       For this study, 48 patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 will be randomly assigned       to four study groups: control, saline, chlorhexidine gluconate, and povidone-iodine.

These patients often require intubation and       ventilator support in order to sustain adequate oxygenation. Once a COVID-19 patient is       intubated, Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) is a mainstay of treatment and is used in       order to improve lung function, treat underlying atelectasis, improve oxygenation, and       improve survival. In fact, early clinical data as well as reports from front line physicians       treating COVID-19 suggest that PEEP has been the most effective treatment modality. In many       cases, PEEP has resulted in improved oxygenation and improved survival.       PEEP decreases the propensity for the alveoli to collapse by increasing the air pressure in       the lungs. This residual pressure in the lungs at the end of exhalation decreases shunting       and allows for more complete gas exchange and improved oxygenation. In patients, PEEP is one       of the safest ways to increase PaO2 and is used on almost all modern ventilator settings.       The GO2 PEEP MOUTHPIECE is a simple, comfortable, and straightforward mouthpiece with a       bidirectional valve that effectively delivers PEEP with every breath. Early application of       the GO2 PEEP MOUTHPIECE in non-intubated COVID-19 patients may improve outcomes and save       lives. Furthermore, this device may allow for less strain on limited resources, especially       ventilators. This PEEP mouthpiece could be employed under an oxygen non-rebreather mask to       improve oxygenation and avoid intubation.

First, although the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infect lung and intestine, many       patients suddenly take a turn for the worse even when the viral replication appears to be       under control. Second, patients with serious or critical clinical symptoms show remarked T       cell lymphopenia that are more severe and more acute than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)       infection. Functional exhaustion of T cells is suggested by high expression of T-cell       exhaustion markers, which again appears more acute than in HIV patients. Third, multiple       cytokines are elevated among patients with severe clinical symptoms, which potentially       explains the multiple organ failure associated with COVID-19. For these reasons, treatment of       COVID-19 likely requires a combination of both antivirals and non-antivirals-based       approaches.       CD24Fc is a biological immunomodulator in Phase II/III clinical trial stage. CD24Fc comprises       the nonpolymorphic regions of CD24 attached to the Fc region of human IgG1. We have shown       that CD24 is an innate checkpoint against the inflammatory response to tissue injuries or       danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Preclinical and clinical studies have       demonstrated that CD24Fc effectively address the major challenges associated with COVID-19.       First, a Phase I clinical trial on healthy volunteers not only demonstrated safety of CD24Fc,       but also demonstrated its biological activity in suppressing expression of multiple       inflammatory cytokines. Second, in Phase II clinical trial in leukemia patients undergoing       hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), three doses of CD24Fc effectively eliminated       severe (Grade 3-4) acute graft vs host diseases (GVHD), which is caused by over reacting       immune system and transplanted T cells attacking recipient target tissues. Third, in       preclinical models of HIV/SIV infections, we have shown that CD24Fc ameliorated production of       multiple inflammatory cytokines, reversed the loss of T lymphocytes as well as functional T       cell exhaustion and reduced the leukocyte infiltration of multiple organs. It is particularly       noteworthy that CD24Fc reduced the rate of pneumonia in SIV-infected Chinese rhesus monkey       from 83% to 33%. Therefore, CD24Fc maybe a prime candidate for non-antiviral biological       modifier for COVID-19 therapy. The phase III trial will involve 270 patients randomized into       blinded placebo and CD24Fc arms, with time to clinical improvement from critical or severe to       mild symptom as the primary endpoint.     ","       The study is designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, multicenter, Phase       III trial to compare two COVID-19 treatment regimens in hospitalized adult subjects who are       diagnosed with severe and critical COVID 19.

ARM I: Patients receive tocilizumab intravenously (IV) every 12 hours for up to 3 doses in       the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive standard       of care.       ARM II: Patients receive standard of care.     ,       This phase III trial compares the effect of adding tocilizumab to standard of care versus       standard of care alone in treating cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in patients with       SARS-CoV-2 infection. CRS is a potentially serious disorder caused by the release of an       excessive amount of substance that is made by cells of the immune system (cytokines) as a       response to viral infection. Tocilizumab is used to decrease the body's immune response.       Adding tocilizumab to standard of care may work better in treating CRS in patients with       SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to standard of care alone.     ,The 7-day length of invasive MV for each arm will be estimated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the exact binomial distribution.

NCT04312243,2020-04-07,Recruiting,Phase 2,Interventional,NO Prevention of COVID-19 for Healthcare Providers,Nitric Oxide Gas Inhalation for Prevention of COVID-19 in Healthcare Providers,Coronavirus Infections|Healthcare Associated Infection,Inhaled nitric oxide gas,All,18,99,Accepts Healthy Volunteers,02114,Prevention,Randomized,Parallel Assignment,,None (Open Label),"       In their efforts to provide care for patients with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease       (COVID-19) infection, many healthcare workers around the globe exposed to SARS-CoV-2 got       infected and died over the past two months. Quarantined nurses and physicians have become the       norm in regions with COVID-19 patients, putting at risk the overall functionality of the       regional healthcare system. Other than strict contact-precautions, no proven vaccination or       targeted therapy is available to prevent COVID-19 in healthcare workers. Inhaled nitric oxide       gas (NO) has shown in a small clinical study to have antiviral activity against a Coronavirus       during the 2003 SARS outbreak. We have designed this study to assess whether intermittent       inhaled NO in healthcare workers might prevent their infection with SARS-CoV-2.       Background: After almost two months of fight against COVID-19 infection, on February 24, more       than 3,000 physicians and nurses were reported as contracting COVID-19 disease in Wuhan       (China). Fatalities among those healthcare workers were reported to be related to SARS-CoV-2       infection. Implementation of strict contact protections for all healthcare personnel is       essential to decrease and contain the risks of exposure. However, despite best efforts,       dozens of thousands of healthcare providers have been quarantined for at least 14 consecutive       days in Wuhan alone. Similarly data have been reported in Italy, several healthcare providers       have been quarantined, developed pneumonia and died. Most recent information from Italy       reported that 12% of healthcare workers are infected.       The shortage of hospital personnel, especially in the critical care and anesthesiology       domains, led many hospitals to postpone indefinitely scheduled surgical procedures, including       cardiac surgery or oncological procedures. Only urgent and emergent cases are performed in       patients without symptoms (i.e., absence of fever, cough or dyspnea), no signs (i.e.,       negative chest CT for consolidations, normal complete blood count) and a negative test on       SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase (rt)-PCR. If time does not allow for thorough screening       (i.e., after traumatic injury), such patients are considered to be infected and medical staff       in the OR are fully protected with third degree protections (i.e., N95 masks, goggles,       protective garments and a gown and double gloving).       Rationale. In 2004 in a collaborative study between the virology laboratory at the University       of Leuven (Belgium), the Clinical Physiology Laboratory of Uppsala University (Sweden) and       the General Airforce Hospital of China (Beijing, China), nitric oxide (NO) donors (e.g.       S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine) greatly increased the survival rate of infected eukaryotic       cells with the coronavirus responsible for SARS (SARS-CoV-1), suggesting direct antiviral       effects of NO. These authors suggest that oxidation is the antiviral mechanism of nitric       oxide. A later work by Akerstrom and colleagues showed that NO or its derivatives reduce       palmitoylation SARS-CoV spike (S) protein affecting its fusion with angiotensin converting       enzyme 2. Furthermore, NO or its derivatives reduce viral RNA synthesis in the infected       cells. Future in-vitro studies should confirm that NO donors are equally effective against       SARS-CoV-2, as the current virus shares 88% of its genome with the SARS-CoV [3]. However, at       present it is reasonable to assess that a high dose of inhaled NO might be anti-viral against       SARS-CoV-2 in the lung. The virus is transmitted by human-to-human contact and occurs       primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes within a range of about 1.5       meters. The incubation period ranges from 1 to 14 days with an estimated median incubation       period of 5 to 6 days according to the World Health Organization [1]. COVID-19 disease is       mainly a respiratory system disease, but in the most severe forms can progress to impair also       other organ function (i.e., kidneys, liver, heart). Nitric oxide gas inhalation has been       successfully and safely used for decades (since 1990) in thousands of newborns and adults to       decrease pulmonary artery pressure and improve systemic oxygenation.       Recently at the Massachusetts General Hospital, a high dose of inhaled NO (160 ppm) for 30 -       60 minutes was delivered twice a day to an adolescent with cystic fibrosis and pulmonary       infection due to multi-resistant Burkholderia cepacia. There were no adverse events to this       patient, blood methemoglobin remained below 5% and lung function and overall well-being       improved.       Clinical Gap. Thousands of healthcare workers have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and       contracted COVID-19 despite their best efforts to prevent contamination. No proven vaccine is       available to protect healthcare workers against SARS-CoV-2.       Hypothesis. Due to genetic similarities with the Coronavirus responsible for SARS, it is       expected that inhaled NO gas retains potent antiviral activity against the SARS-CoV-2       responsible for COVID-19.       Aim. To assess whether intermittent delivery of inhaled NO gas in air at a high dose may       protect healthcare workers from SARS-CoV-2 infection.       Observational group: daily symptoms and body temperature monitoring. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test       will be performed if fever or COVID-19 symptoms.       Treatment group: the subjects will breathe NO at 160 parts per million (ppm) for two cycles       of 15 minutes each at the beginning of each shift and before leaving the hospital. Daily       symptoms and body temperature monitoring. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test will be performed if fever       or COVID-19 symptoms. Safety: Oxygenation and methemoglobin levels will be monitored via a       non-invasive CO-oximeter. If methemoglobin levels rise above 5% at any point of the gas       delivery, inhaled NO will be stopped. NO2 gas will be monitored and maintained below 5 ppm.       Blinding. The treatment is not masked.     ",       Thousands of healthcare workers have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and contracted COVID-19       despite their best efforts to prevent contamination.

NCT04342169,2020-04-04,Recruiting,Phase 2,Interventional,University of Utah COVID-19 Hydrochloroquine Trial,Hydroxychloroquine for Outpatients With Confirmed COVID-19,Coronavirus|Coronavirus Infection|Infectious Disease,Hydroxychloroquine;Placebo oral tablet,All,18,,No,84108,Treatment,Randomized,Parallel Assignment,,None (Open Label),"       Background COVID-19 is pandemic with high mortality among hospitalized patients despite a       benign course in the large majority of patients infected. Limited data are available from       small outpatient studies and have not shown efficacy in preventing hospitalization.       Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine have antiviral and immune-modulating effects, but       there are no data concerning their efficacy in reducing viral load and shedding in       outpatients.       Evidence supporting possible efficacy for hydroxychloroquine. In cell models, chloroquine       both interferes with terminal glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor (the cell surface receptor       by which SARS-CoV2 enters human cells) and increases endosomal pH, which interferes (at least       in vitro) with a crucial step in viral replication.1,2 HCQ is 5x more potent than chloroquine       in a Vero cell model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In independent experiments, chloroquine has       confirmed in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, HCQ has in vitro efficacy       against SARS-CoV-1. According to news releases, an as-yet-unpublished set of case series in       China (N reportedly 120) suggests the possibility of rapid viral clearance and low rates of       progression to critical illness. In addition to in vitro anti-viral effects chloroquine and       HCQ appear to have immune-modulatory effects, especially via suppression of release of TNF       and IL6, especially in macrophages.       Evidence against efficacy for hydroxychloroquine. Chloroquine and HCQ have been promoted as       extremely broad anti-infective agents for decades. The reported effects include suppression       of fungi, atypical bacteria, and viruses. Other than the effects on ACE2 glycosylation, the       mechanisms invoked as evidence for efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 have also been invoked for a       wide range of viruses. However, when chloroquine and HCQ have been studied in humans, neither       agent has demonstrated consistent efficacy in clinical trials, including in HIV, influenza,       hepatitis, and Dengue. In one trial, chloroquine resulted in increased viral replication in       Chikungunya virus [Roques et al, Viruses 2018 May 17;10(5)] while in another       hydroxychloroquine was associated with increased HIV viral load [Paton et al, JAMA 2012 Jul       25;308(4):353]. Expert opinion advises against HCQ for MERS, another serious coronavirus. An       underpowered (n=30) study of HCQ in COVID-19 recently published in China did not demonstrate       any clinical benefit [Chen et al, J Zhejiang University, 2020 March 9]. The long history of       clinical failure despite in vitro anti-viral activity suggests a low probability of efficacy.       Rationale for Trial There is significant publicity concerning the potential use of HCQ in       this pandemic, and many patients are seeking access to this unproven therapy. The ANZICS       guidelines emphasize that novel treatments should be administered within clinical trials; the       Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines (http://bit.ly/SSCCOVID-19) also affirm the lack of       evidence to support the clinical use of (hydroxy)chloroquine. WHO guidance       (https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331446/WHO-2019-nCoV-clinical-2020.4-eng.pd       f) also strongly affirms that investigational anti-COVID-19 therapeutics should be done       under ethically approved, randomized, controlled trials. The evidence thus strongly favors       equipoise.     ","       A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is responsible for a rapidly spreading pandemic that has       reached 160 countries, infecting over 500,000 individuals and killing more than 24,000       people. SARS-CoV-2 causes an acute and potentially lethal respiratory illness, known as       COVID-19, that is threatening to overwhelm health care systems due to a dramatic surge in       hospitalized and critically ill patients. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 typically have       been symptomatic for 5-7 days prior to admission, indicating that there is a window during       which an effective intervention could significantly alter the course of illness, lessen       disease spread, and alleviate the stress on hospital resources.       There is no known treatment for COVID-19, though in vitro and one poorly controlled study       have identified a potential antiviral activity for HCQ. The rationale for this clinical trial       is to measure the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine for reducing viral load and       shedding in adult outpatients with confirmed COVID-19.

This       high mortality may be driven by hyperinflammation resembling cytokine release syndrome (CRS),       offering the hope that therapies targeting the interleukin-6 (IL-6) axis therapies commonly       used to treat CRS can be used to reduce COVID-19 mortality. Retrospective analysis of severe       to critical COVID-19 patients receiving tocilizumab demonstrated that the majority of       patients had rapid resolution (i.e., within 24-72 hours following administration) of both       clinical and biochemical signs (fever and CRP, respectively) of hyperinflammation with only a       single tocilizumab dose.

The lifetime prevalence of anxiety in       MS is estimated at 48.9%, compared to 37.9% in the general population. The negative       consequences of anxiety for individuals with MS include impairment of work function and       workplace attrition, increased healthcare usage and healthcare costs, increased physical       disability (i.e., higher Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score), and reduced overall       quality of life. And while anxiety has been shown to be acutely elevated both before and in       the first years after diagnosis, individuals with longstanding MS also exhibit anxiety at       higher rates than the general population.

Given the rapid spread of infection, the rapid depletion of hospital       resources due to high influxes of patients, and the current absence of specific therapeutic       drugs and vaccines for treatment of COVID-19 infection, it is essential to detect onset of       the disease at its early stages. Radiological examinations, the most common of which are       posteroanterior chest X-ray (PCX) images, play an important role in the diagnosis of       COVID-19. The objective of this study is to assess three configurations of two convolutional       deep neural network architectures for the classification of COVID-19 PCX images. The primary       experimental dataset consisted of 115 COVID-19 positive and 115 COVID-19 negative PCX images,       the latter comprising roughly equally many pneumonia, emphysema, fibrosis, and healthy images       (230 total images). Two common convolutional neural network architectures were used, VGG16       and DenseNet121, the former initially configured with off-the-shelf (OTS) parameters and the       latter with either OTS or exclusively X-ray trained (XRT) parameters. The OTS parameters were       derived from training on the ImageNet dataset, while the XRT parameters were obtained from       training on the NIH chest X-ray dataset, ChestX-ray14. A final, densely connected layer was       added to each model, the parameters of which were trained and validated on 87% of images from       the experimental dataset, for the task of binary classification of images as COVID-19       positive or COVID-19 negative. Each model was tested on a hold-out set consisting of the       other 13% of images.

Hypertension and cardiovascular disease are risk factors       for death in COVID-19. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an important component of the       renin-angiotensin system, serves as the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 and facilitates host cell       entry in the lungs. In experimental models, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)       and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to increase ACE2 expression in       several organs, potentially promoting viral cell invasion, although these findings are not       consistent across studies. Alternatively, ACEIs and ARBs may actually improve mechanisms of       host defense or hyperinflammation, ultimately reducing organ injury. Finally, ACEIs and ARBs       may have direct renal, pulmonary and cardiac protective benefits in the setting of COVID-19.       Therefore, it is unclear if ACEIs and ARBs may be beneficial or harmful in patients with       COVID-19. Given the high prevalence of hypertension, cardiovascular and renal disease in the       world, the high prevalence of ACEIs or ARBs in these conditions, and the clinical equipoise       regarding the continuation vs. discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs in the setting of COVID, a       randomized trial is urgently needed.

It is estimated that COVID-19 will be       lethal for up to 200,000 Americans. Several cardiovascular manifestations have been reported       to be associated with the disease or its treatment and might be contributing to its high       mortality rates.1,2 The National Health Commission of China (NHC) documented that       approximately 12% of patients without prior cardiovascular disease (CVD) who expired in the       setting of COVID-19 had either elevated cardiac troponin I levels or a cardiac arrest during       hospitalization.3 Furthermore, patients with underlying cardiovascular comorbidities       experience worse outcomes when infected with SARS-CoV-2.1 Acute myocarditis, acute myocardial       injury, and heart failure have been associated with COVID-19.3 However, most of these       associations come from small observational studies or from comparisons with other       coronaviruses.3 The hypothesized pathogenetic mechanism of CVD in COVID-19 includes either       direct effects of the virus to the cardiac cells expressing the angiotensin- converting       enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, or indirect effects from the severe systemic inflammatory response,       cytokine surge and immune system activation. The exact effect of COVID-19 on the       cardiovascular system though is still not well known. This study seeks to identify the       prevalence of CVD and its role in clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients diagnosed with       COVID-19 in a large tertiary center of Houston, TX. CVD associated with COVID-19 might be       contributing to the high mortality rates and its recognition will allow for prevention, early       diagnosis and appropriate treatment. This will be the first, large, case-control study       assessing cardiovascular involvement of COVID-19 in a well-defined cohort of patients.       Methods:       Study population and data handling:       A retrospective observational case-control study will be performed. Multiple hospitals will       participate in the current study and the study protocol will be submitted separately to each       local IRB for approval. Subjects admitted to the participating hospitals from March 30th,       2020 to March 30th, 2021, who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR will be identified through       the microbiology lab registry. Subjects who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR will       be age- and gender-matched with subjects admitted to the hospital with similar symptoms but       negative PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 (one negative PCR test for patients of low clinical       suspicion and two negative tests, 24 hours apart from each other, for patients of high       clinical suspicion). Demographic, clinical, laboratory and imaging findings will be collected       by retrospective electronic chart review. The current study will not involve face-to-face       patient contact and does not intent to alter the usual care of the patients involved. The       collected data will be deidentified and stored in a HIPAA approved, password-secured       designated folder of the UTH-share drive of the University of Texas Health Science Center at       Houston. No patient information will be stored or processed in any personal electronic       devices. A total of 500 study subjects are estimated to be included in the study. Upon       completion of the study, the data will be stored for an additional 5 years; following that       all research-related files will be permanently deleted.       Data collection:       Demographic characteristics including age at the time of diagnosis, gender, race and body       mass index will be collected. Past medical history including coronary artery disease, heart       failure with reduced or preserved ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation, hypertension,       dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking status as well as home medications will be       abstracted. The name and daily dose of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers will       be recorded. Laboratory values including cardiac enzymes, electrolytes, hemoglobin and       creatinine will be collected. Available electrocardiograms (EKGs) and transthoracic       echocardiograms (TTEs) will be individually reviewed by an independent cardiovascular disease       fellow or a cardiovascular disease faculty member who will be blinded to the SARS-CoV-2 PCR       results. Finally, clinical outcomes including need for mechanical ventilation, length of       intensive care unit stay, length of hospitalization, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest and       in-hospital mortality will be abstracted from the electronic charts.       Statistical analysis:       Continuous variables will be tested for distribution. Normally distributed variables will be       presented as mean values +/- standard deviation (SD) and compared using the student''s t test.       Non-normally distributed variables will be presented as median values with interquartile       ranges and compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Categorical variables will be presented as       percentages and compared using chi-square test. Multivariable regression analysis will be       performed to control for possible cofounder. A two-sided p-value of less than 0.05 will be       considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses will be performed using STATA       15 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).     ","       Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen responsible for       the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The first reports of COVID-19 came from Wuhan,       China in December of 2019. Since then, the disease has spread rapidly around the globe,       accounting for thousands of deaths in multiple countries. On March 11th, 2020, the World       Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. Although COVID-19 manifests primarily as       a respiratory illness, several cardiovascular implications have been reported related to its       natural course and treatment. Its exact effect on the cardiovascular system though is       currently unknown. Therefore, we propose a retrospective, observational, case-control study       looking for cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19, including laboratory evidence of       myocardial injury, electrocardiographic changes, arrhythmias and echocardiographic       abnormalities. Hospitalized patients admitted with fever, cough, sore throat, and/or dyspnea       who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 will be included in our study and will be matched       based on their age and gender with patients admitted with similar symptoms who tested       negative for SARS-CoV-2. The electronic medical charts of the study subjects will be reviewed       and relevant demographic, clinical, laboratory and imaging findings will be deidentified and       recorded. Since our study will be a retrospective chart review study it carries minimal risk       for the patients and the investigators. Cardiovascular disease associated with COVID-19 might       be contributing to the high mortality rates and its recognition will allow for prevention,       early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. This will be the first, large, case-control study       assessing cardiovascular involvement of COVID-19 in a well-defined cohort of patients.

A draft paper was released recently in March by Didier Raoult       from Aix-Marseille University in France on a preliminary trial of 36 COVID-19 patients. In       this trial, 6 patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory symptoms, and 8 had lower       respiratory symptoms. Between early and mid-March, they treated 20 of these patients with 600       mg of hydroxychloroquine daily in a hospital setting. Some patient also received the       antibiotic azithromycin. 16 patients served as the controls. They observed a significant       reduction in viral load in patients with hydroxychloroquine. After 6 days, 70% of the treated       patients were considered cured (no virus detected in their samples) compared to 12.5% of       controls. All 6 patients who received both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were negative       for the virus after 6 days. This was an unblinded, non-randomized trial.       Vitamin C has multiple in-vivo effects on immune modulation that may, in sum, limit the       development of the cytokine excess associated with critical illness. It is currently being       studied in a clinical trial as a treatment for severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in China and       recommended as a supplement in standard treatment of COVID-19.       There are no medications currently approved for treatment of COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine is       a known drug with low toxicity that may reduce progression of respiratory symptoms and       resulting hospitalizations. This randomized control study will assess its potential as an       off-label treatment in reducing the rates of hospitalization and subsequent mechanical       ventilation from COVID-19 infection compared to standard of care treatment with Vitamin C. A       randomized control trial with placebo is impractical due to the increasing availability of       this medication to the public.

Current estimates suggest that the       novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is both highly contagious (estimated reproductive rate, 2-3)       and five to fifty-fold more lethal than seasonal influenza (estimated mortality rate,       0.5-5%). Interventions to decrease the incidence and severity of COVID-19 are emergently       needed.       Hydroxychloroquine (brand name, Plaquenil), an inexpensive anti-malarial medication with       immunomodulatory effects, is a promising therapy for COVID-19. Chloroquine, a related       compound with a less favorable toxicity profile, has shown benefit in clinical studies       conducted in approximately one-hundred SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. In vitro,       hydroxychloroquine has been recently shown to have greater efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 versus       chloroquine.       Currently, there is no established post-exposure prophylaxis for persons at high risk of       developing COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine (brand name, Plaquenil), is a medicine that has been       found to be effective against the novel coronavirus in some recent experiments. Previously,       hydroxychloquine has been safety used to prevent malaria or to treat autoimmune diseases.       This study will test if hydroxychloroquine may be used to prevent the development of COVID-19       symptoms in persons who live with an individual who has been diagnosed with COVID-19. If       hydroxychloroquine is shown to reduce the risk of developing symptoms of COVID-19 among       people at high risk of infection, this could help to reduce the morbidity and mortality of       the COVID-19 epidemic.       This is a trial of hydroxychloroquine PEP among adult household contacts of COVID-19 patients       in New York City (NYC). The trial will be initiated at NewYork-Presbyterian (NYP)/Columbia       University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC).

The investigators will enroll 250 people who had COVID-19       based on lab testing to participate. Participants will complete a survey at enrollment. The       investigators will also collect blood, nose swab, saliva, stool, semen, and breast milk to       test for the virus. The investigators will ask participants to complete a survey and give       specimens up to 8 times over 6 months. This information will be used to study how long the       virus can live in different parts of the body, antibody development, and post-infectious       complications.

The elevated death risk estimates are probably associated with a            breakdown of the healthcare system, indicating that enhanced public health            interventions, including social distancing and movement restrictions, should be            implemented to bring the COVID-19 epidemic under control.

The recovering patients are presenting with mild to severe lung impairment as a result of the       viral attack on the alveolar and lung tissues. Clinically significant impairment of pulmonary       function appears to be a permanent finding as a direct result of the interstitial lung damage       and inflammatory changes that accompanied.       This Phase 0, first-in-kind for humans, is use of autologous, cSVF deployed intravenously to       examine the anti-inflammatory and structural potential to improve the residual damaged       tissues.       Previous utilization of cSVF remains in Clinical Trials at this moment for uses in Chronic       Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrotic Lung disorders,       showing encouraging safety profile and clinical efficacy. It is the intention of this study,       driven by the ongoing pandemic as a direct causative etiology for permanent lung damage       within the oxygen/carbon dioxide exchange resulting the the direct alveolar disruption and       scarring reaction.       The inflammatory mediation, autoimmune modulatory capabilities, and revascularization       potentials of the cSVF is becoming well recognized and documented in peer-reviewed literature       and in scientific studies.       Due to the urgency presented from the ongoing CoronaVirus pandemic, many patients that       survive experience demonstrate direct pulmonary damage residua. There is available a relative       new technology offered by Fluidda Inc in European Union (EU) known as Functional Respiratory       Imaging (FRI) and examines pulmonary function and vascular capabilities in damaged lung       tissues. This study examines the lung baseline (post-infection), and at 3 and 6 month       intervals post-cSVF treatment to examine the functional airway configuration and efficiency       at those intervals.       Sporadic reports of use of stem cells or stem/stromal cells have revealed some positive       clinical outcomes, although not within a traditional randomized trial format at this point in       time. This study proposed in the specific situation of permanent residual dysfunction created       by the SARS-Co2 (Coronavirus) infection is felt to warrant a pilot study using the cSVF that       is in current Clinical Trials, which, at this point presents a very good safety profile with       the absence of adverse event (AE) or severe adverse events (SAE) as yet reported by the       trials.

Columbia University Irving Medical Center/NewYork-Presbyterian (CUIMC/NYP)       has assembled a team of committed virologists, molecular biologists, chemists, and       technologists to address this emerging threat. Monoclonal antibodies have become great       additions to our therapeutic arsenal, primarily in treating cancer or autoimmune diseases.       Recently, the use of monoclonal antibodies in combating infections such as respiratory       syncytial virus and HIV have also become clear. In recent years, advanced cell sorting and       sequencing technologies have been utilized to identify neutralizing antibodies from human B       cells.

If the       potential participant agrees to be contacted, study staff will call them to review the       informed consent, eligibility criteria and study procedures, and set up a study visit for       blood draw. Monoclonal antibodies that could potently neutralize 2019 novel coronavirus       (2019-nCoV) and related coronaviruses will be isolated from these specimens. Candidate       monoclonal antibodies will then be optimized and evaluated for therapeutic potential.

This study will collect demographic data,       clinical examen at prehospital/emergency room and ICU admission (including neurological       signs), and all ancillary exams performed to identify a cause of neurological impairment.       Outcome will be evaluated using the Glasgow Outcome Scale score at ICU and hospital       discharge, and day-90 after ICU admission.       Acute encephalopathy will be defined as recently stated :       1. The term acute encephalopathy refers to a rapidly developing (over less than 4 weeks, but       usually within hours to a few days) pathobiological process in the brain. This is a preferred       term 2. Acute encephalopathy can lead to a clinical presentation of subsyndromal delirium,       delirium, or in case of a severely decreased level of consciousness, coma; all representing a       change from baseline cognitive status 3. The term delirium refers to a clinical state       characterized by a combination of features defined by diagnostic systems such as the DSM-5.       Delirium according to the DSM-5 is defined if criterium A-E are fulfilled: A. Disturbance in       attention (i.e., reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and shift attention) and       awareness (reduced orientation to the environment). B. The disturbance develops over a short       period of time (usually hours to a few days) represents a change from baseline attention and       awareness, and tends to fluctuate in severity during the course of the day. C. An additional       disturbance in cognition (e.g., memory deficit, disorientation, language, visuospatial       ability, or perception). D. The disturbances in criteria A and C are not explained by another       pre-existing, established, or evolving neurocognitive disorder, and do not occur in the       context of a severely reduced level of arousal, such as coma. E. There is evidence from the       history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is a direct       physiologic consequence of another medical condition, substance intoxication or withdrawal       (i.e. because of a drug of abuse medication), or exposure to a toxin, or is because of       multiple etiologies.

The infection affects all ages of life, although affecting       children in a very small proportion of cases. The typical presentation of the disease       combines fever (98%), cough (76%), myalgia and asthenia (18%) as well as leukopenia (25%) and       lymphopenia (63%). Upper airway involvement rare.       The main clinical presentation requiring hospitalization of infected patients is that of       atypical pneumonia which may require critical care management (27%), and progress to an acute       respiratory distress syndrome (67%) involving life-threatening conditions in almost 25% of       patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other organ damage have been reported, mainly       concerning kidney damage (29%) which may require renal replacement therapy in approximately       17% of patients.       Neurological damage has been very rarely studied, yet reported in 36% of cases in a study       including patients of varying severity.       Finally, the mortality associated with this emerging virus is high in patients for whom       critical care management is necessary, reported in 62% of patients.       We therefore propose a prospective observational study which aim at reporting the prevalence       of acute encephalopathy at initial management in Critical/Intensive care or Neurocritical       care , to report its morbidity and mortality and to identify prognostic factors.

","       Background: During the current COVID-19 pandemic there is urgent need for information about       the natural history of the infection in non-hospitalized patients, including the severity and       duration of symptoms, and outcome from early in the infection, among different subgroups of       patients. In addition, a large, real-world data registry can provide information about how       different concomitant medications may differentially affect symptoms among patient subgroups.       Such information can be invaluable for clinicians managing chronic diseases during this       pandemic, as well as identify interventions undertaken in a naturalistic setting that have       differential effects. Such factors may include patient diet, over the counter or prescription       medications, and herbal and alternative treatments, among others. Identifying the natural       disease history in patients from different demographic and disease subgroups will be       important for identifying at-risk patients and effectiveness of interventions undertaken in       the community.       Objectives: The purpose of this study is to understand at the population level the       symptomatic course of known or suspected COVID-19 patients while sheltering-in-place or under       quarantine. Symptoms will be measured using a daily report derived from the CTCAE-PRO as well       as free response.

Antiviral combined with adjuvant therapies are currently under investigation. The       clinical spectrum of the infection is wide, ranging from mild signs of upper respiratory       tract infection to severe pneumonia and death.       In the patients who progress, the time period from symptoms onset to development of dyspnea       is reported to be between 5 to 10 days, and that one to severe respiratory distress syndrome       from 10 to 14 days. Globally, 15 to 18% of patients deteriorates to the need of mechanical       ventilation, despite the use of non-invasive ventilatory support in the earliest phases of       the disease. Probability of progression to end stage disease is unpredictable, with the       majority of these patients dying from multi-organ failure. Preventing progression in       spontaneously breathing patients with mild to moderate disease would translate in improved       morbidity and mortality and in a lower use of limited healthcare resources.       In 2004, during the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak, a pilot study showed that low dose       ( max 30 ppm) inhaled NO for 3 days was able to shorten the time of ventilatory support. At       the same time, NO donor compound S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine increased survival rate in       an in-vitro model of SARS-CoV infected epithelial cells.Based on the genetic similarities       between the two viruses, similar effects of NO on SARS-CoV-2 can be hypothesized. While       further in-vitro testing is recommended, we proposed a randomized clinical trial to test the       effectiveness of inhaled NO in preventing the progression of SARS-CoV-2 related disease, when       administered at an early stage.     ","       The scientific community is in search for novel therapies that can help to face the ongoing       epidemics of novel Coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) originated in China in December 2019. At present,       there are no proven interventions to prevent progression of the disease. Some preliminary       data on SARS pneumonia suggest that inhaled Nitric Oxide (NO) could have beneficial effects       on SARS-CoV-2 due to the genomic similarities between this two coronaviruses. In this study       we will test whether inhaled NO therapy prevents progression in patients with mild to       moderate COVID-19 disease.

The study is a multicenter trial that will be conducted in up to approximately 100       sites globally. The study will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a       control arm. There will be interim monitoring to introduce new arms and allow early stopping       for futility, efficacy, or safety. If one therapy proves to be efficacious, then this       treatment may become the control arm for comparison(s) with new experimental treatment(s).       Any such change would be accompanied by an updated sample size. Because background standards       of supportive care may evolve/improve over time as more is learned about successful       management of COVID-19, comparisons of safety and efficacy will be based on data from       concurrently randomized subjects. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will       actively monitor interim data to make recommendations about early study closure or changes to       study arms.       The initial sample size is projected to be 572 subjects to achieve 400 subjects with a       recovered status (per the primary objective). The primary analysis will be based on those       subjects enrolled in order to 400 recoveries. An additional analysis of the moderate severity       subgroup (those with baseline status of Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen or       Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care) is also       of public health importance. Hence, enrollment will be permitted until the date of April 20,       2020 to ensure 400 recoveries and provide additional data about this important subgroup. With       recent enrollment rates, the total sample size may be 600 to over 800.       Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. If the subjects are discharged from the       hospital, they will have a study visit at Days 15, 22, and 29 as an outpatient. For       discharged subjects, it is preferred that the Day 15 and 29 visits are in person to obtain       safety laboratory tests and OP swab and blood (serum only) samples for secondary research as       well as clinical outcome data. However, infection control or other restrictions may limit the       ability of the subject to return to the clinic. In this case, Day 15 and 29 visits may be       conducted by phone, and only clinical data will be obtained. The Day 22 visit does not have       laboratory tests or collection of samples and may also be conducted by phone.       All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments. Safety       laboratory tests and blood (serum and plasma) research samples and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs       will be obtained on Days 1 (prior to infusion) and Days 3, 5, 8, and 11 (while hospitalized).       OP swabs and blood (serum only) plus safety laboratory tests will be collected on Day 15 and       29 (if the subject attends an in-person visit or are still hospitalized).       The primary outcome is time to recovery by Day 29. A key secondary outcome evaluates       treatment-related improvements in the 8-point ordinal scale at Day 15.

Patients are excluded if       they were transferred from an out-of-system hospital, died within 24 hours of presentation to       the ED, or were admitted for less than 24 hours. A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as       a patient that had a positive reverse-transcriptase-polymerase- chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay       for SARS-CoV-2 in a nasopharyngeal sample.       Patients are risk stratified by severity of symptoms on presentation to the hospital as mild,       moderate, or severe COVID-19. Patients without hypoxia or exertional dyspnea were considered       to have mild COVID-19. Patients with mild COVID-19 were treated with symptom relief only and       not admitted to the hospital. Patients who presented with infiltrates on chest radiography       and required supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula or HFNC were classified as having moderate       COVID-19. Patients who had respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation were       classified as having severe COVID-19.       This is a multi-center quasi-experimental study at HFHS, comprised of five hospitals in       southeast and south-central Michigan. The study was approved by the institution''s       Investigational Review Board (#13739) with waiver of consent. Patients in the       pre-corticosteroid protocol group from March 12, 2020 through March 19, 2020 were compared to       a corticosteroid protocol group that included patients from March 20, 2020 through March 27,       2020.       Patients in both study groups received standard care, comprised of supplemental oxygen, HFNC,       invasive ventilation, antibiotic agents, antiviral agents, vasopressor support, and       renal-replacement therapy, as determined by the primary team. Patients who progressed to ARDS       were managed with standard of care.       Data was ascertained from each institution''s electronic medical record and recorded in a       standardized electronic case report form. Demographic data, information on clinical symptoms       or signs at presentation, and laboratory and radiologic results during admission. All       laboratory tests and radiologic assessments, including plain chest radiography and computed       tomography of the chest, were performed at the discretion of the treating physician.       Coexisting conditions were ascertained from electronic medical record and physician       documentation. The National Early Warning Score (NEWS) was collected to evaluate baseline       illness severity based on vital signs obtained in the Emergency Department. Additionally, the       quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) was used to evaluate severity of illness of       included patients based on ED vitals and examination. All patients were followed for at least       14 days after initial presentation. Patient data was censored on April 9, 2020.       Statistical Analysis: Continuous variables were reported as median and interquartile range       (IQR) and compared using the Mann-Whitney test or t-test, as appropriate. Categorical data       was reported as number and percentage (no., %) and compared using the chi-squared test or       Fisher''s exact test, as appropriate. No imputation was made for missing data points. The       sample size was derived from all eligible consecutive hospitalized patients during the study       period. A two-sided α < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Bivariate and       multivariable logistic regression analysis was planned a-priori to test the association       between the composite endpoint and exposure to the corticosteroid protocol. Covariates in the       bivariate analysis with a p-value <0.2 and clinical rationale were included in a       multivariable regression model that was restricted to a subject-to-variable ratio of 10:1.

Fever worsens and hypothermia mitigates animal       models of ALI and in small non-randomized in patients with ARDS. Since hypothermia reduces       oxygen utilization as long as shivering is blocked, TH may reduce injury in part by allowing       lower levels of assisted ventilation. TH likely exerts additional lung protective effects by       directly modifying temperature-dependent cellular processes in endothelium, epithelium, and       leukocytes. Neuromuscular blockade (NMB) is the ultimate treatment to block shivering and is       frequently used in patients with ARDS to facilitate ventilator management. Since the recently       completed NHLBI PETAL ROSE trial showed that NMB caused conferred neither benefit nor harm in       patients with moderate to severe ARDS, the investigators have bundled TH with NMB to reduce       shivering. An open-label study of 8 ARDS patients showed that studying TH + NMB in patients       with moderate to severe ARDS was feasible. Moreover, the patients treated with TH +NMB had       more 28-day ventilator-free days (VFDs), ICU-free days (ICU-FDs) and greater hospital       survival (75% vs. 25%; p = 0.027) than historical controls with ARDS and NMB but without TH.       Within the limits of historical comparisons, these results support further study of TH in       ARDS. A Department of Defense-funded Phase IIb multicenter trial of TH+NMB in patients with       moderate to severe ARDS will begin enrolling in Fall, 2020. Since COVID-19 has become the       most common cause of ARDS, it is important to understand whether patients with       COVID-19-associated ARDS can be included in the multicenter trial.       Focus of Study: We will conduct a single-site feasibility and safety RCT pilot of TH+NMB for       48h vs. usual temperature management in 20 patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS. We will       also analyze efficacy markers to help decide whether the treatment duration (48h) to be used       in the multicenter trial is appropriate for patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS. The       results of this pilot help us decide whether to include patients with COVID-19-associated       ARDS in our planned multicenter trial of TH+NMB in ARDS from all causes or to pursue a       separate trial focused on patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS.       Primary and secondary objectives: The primary objective is to assess the safety and       feasibility of the 48h TH+NMB treatment protocol. The secondary objective is to compare the       TH+NMB and control arms for efficacy markers to be used in the multicenter trial.       Study design: The CHILL trial is a single center RCT.       Intervention: The study intervention is TH to core temperature 34°-35°C + NMB for 48h.       Patients in the TH+NMB arm will receive deep sedation, continuous infusion of cisatracurium       and mechanical ventilation for at least 48h. Decisions about transition to unassisted       breathing, extubation, and transfer from ICU will be based on criteria in the CHILL study       protocol.       TH+NMB: Once sedation and NMB are confirmed, TH to 34°-35°C will be initiated using surface       cooling. Temperature will be measured from a central probe. Once target temperature is       reached, TH will be maintained for 48h. Patients will then be rewarmed to 35.5°C by 0.3°C/h       and the cooling devices removed. Post-TH fever suppression is not part of the CHILL protocol       and will be performed at the discretion of the primary ICU team. TH+NMB will be aborted for       persistent severe bradycardia, uncontrolled bleeding, and intractable arrhythmias.       Usual temperature management: Patients will receive light sedation (RASS 0 to -1). During the       54h post-randomization treatment period, acetaminophen will be given for core temperature       >38°C and surface cooling will be initiated if core temperature remains >38°C within ≥45       minutes of receiving acetaminophen and adjusted to maintain core temperature ≤38°C. If core       temperature ≤36°C, patients in this arm will receive surface warming to core temperature       37°C. Following the 54h treatment period, temperature will be managed at the discretion of       the primary ICU team.       Concomitant Treatment: Since prone positioning independently improves survival in ARDS,       starting and stopping rules for prone positioning have been protocolized.       Primary and Secondary Endpoints:       Primary endpoint: The low and high core temperatures in each 2-hour period will be recorded       for each of the first four study days. The time required to reach the target temperature and       the percent of readings within the target range in the TH+NMB arm will be determined.       Secondary endpoints:       Clinical: (a) 28-day VFDs. The 28-day VFDs will be calculated at day 28. (b) 28-day ICU-FDs:.

Study population: Adult patients with COVID-19 diagnosed by PCR testing within previous            2 weeks and moderate to severe ARDS based on Berlin criteria (P/F < 200 while on PEEP ≥8            cm H2O) <48h in duration.            Data Analysis: This is a pilot trial to determine whether patients with            COVID-19-associated patients with ARDS should be included in a multicenter trial of            TH+NMB in patients with ARDS from all causes. The data from this pilot will not be            merged with data from the planned multicenter trial. The primary analysis of this pilot            study will be to determine the effectiveness of the TH+NMB protocol in maintaining            targeted temperature and to determine whether there are any safety issues with the            TH+NMB protocol in this patient population.            Data Management: Data for this pilot RCT will be recorded on paper CRFs. Completion of            all fields will be checked in real-time. The forms have been designed to be compatible            with the electronic versions developed for the multicenter trial.            Randomization Plan: The investigators will use a randomization protocol stratified for            proning status using pre-generated random assignment lists. Assignments will be made            using an in-house Excel-based assignment tool, which blinds the observer to the            assignment list.            Subject Participation Duration: The duration of intervention, TH + NMB vs. usual            temperature management, is 48h, followed by rewarming for 3-6h in the TH group. NMB will            be discontinued and sedation reduced when subjects are rewarmed to core temperature            ≥35.5°C. In the control group fever and hypothermia during continuous renal replacement            therapy (CRRT) will be treated by protocol for 54h post-randomization. Physiologic and            clinical parameters will be collected through study day 7. In hospital follow-up up to            90 days will include determination of 28-day VFDs and ICU-FDs, and day of hospital            discharge. When the patient regains competence, consent for continued participation will            be obtained            Study Duration: Completion of enrollment is anticipated within 6 months.     ","       Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a serious condition that occurs as a       complication of medical and surgical diseases, has a mortality of ~40%, and has no known       treatment other than optimization of support. Data from basic research, animal models, and       retrospective studies, case series, and small prospective studies suggest that therapeutic       hypothermia (TH) similar to that used for cardiac arrest may be lung protective in patients       with ARDS; however, shivering is a major complication of TH, often requiring paralysis with       neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) to control. Since the recently completed NHLBI PETAL       ROSE trial showed that NMBA had no effect (good or bad) in patients with moderate to severe       ARDS, the investigators sought to evaluate whether TH combined with NMBA is beneficial in       patients with ARDS. The investigators are scheduled to begin enrolling in a Department of       Defense-funded Phase IIb multicenter RCT of TH (core temperature 34-35°C) + NMBA for 48h vs.       usual temperature management in patients with ARDS with time on ventilator as the primary       outcome. Since COVID-19 is now the most common cause of ARDS, we are conducting a pilot study       to examine the safety and feasibility of including patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS in       our upcoming trial. In this pilot, we will randomize 20 patients with COVID-19 and ARDS to       either TH+NMBA for 48h or usual temperature management. The primary outcome is achieving and       maintaining the target temperature. Secondary outcomes include safety, physiologic measures,       mortality, hospital and ICU length of stay, and serum biomarkers collected on days 0, 1, 2,       3, 4, and 7.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for       COVID-19, enters type II pneumocytes using angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE       inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase ACE2 expression.       Theoretically, if ACEI/ARB use increases ACE2 expression in the lungs, ACEI/ARBs could       promote SARS-CoV-2 entry into type II pneumocytes and worsen COVID-19 infection. In contrast,       other evidence suggests that ACEI/ARBs may mitigate virus-induced inflammatory responses in       the lungs by upregulating ACE2-mediated generation of the vasodilator and anti-inflammatory       protein angiotensin-(1-7), thereby preventing tissue damage. Few data exist on the direction       or magnitude of the association between ACEI/ARB use and COVID-19 severity, and whether these       associations differ between ACEIs and ARBs. Because ACEI/ARBs are among the most commonly       used prescription medications, it is critical to determine if ACEI/ARB users have a       differential risk of more severe COVID-19 infection compared to non-users. The objective of       this study is to reduce morbidity and mortality of the COVID-19 pandemic by generating timely       evidence on the direction and magnitude of the association between ACEI/ARB use and COVID-19       severity and mortality.     ","       Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for       COVID-19, enters type II pneumocytes using angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). It is       unclear whether ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) increase,       decrease, or have no significant effect on ACE2 expression or activity. Therefore, ACEI and       ARB may be harmful, beneficial, or have no impact on Coronavirus Disease 2019 severity and       mortality. The Specific Aims of this observational study are: (1) Among SARS-CoV-2-positive       outpatients, compare all-cause hospitalization and mortality rates between: 1.1 Current users       of a range of doses of ACEI/ARB- vs. non- ACEI/ARB-based regimens, and 1.2 Current users of a       range of doses of ACEI- vs. ARB-based regimens, and (2) Among those hospitalized for       COVID-19, compare all-cause mortality between: 2.1 Current users of a range of doses of       ACEI/ARB- vs. non- ACEI/ARB-based regimens, and 2.2 Current users of a range of doses of       ACEI- vs. ARB-based regimens.

Patients will be screened at       the time of hospital admission and will be required to be enrolled within the clinical trial       within 48 hours of hospital admission.       In the individualized, biomarker-concordant arm, all patients will receive steroids once at       the time of admission, then a daily morning dose. In order to account for varying turnaround       time at different laboratories, CRP levels will be drawn with early morning labs, and used to       determine the steroid dosing for the day. Patients will receive daily CRP measurements for       the first 5 days of the hospitalization, or until hospital discharge. CRP measurements will       be discontinued once the CRP is less than 50mmol/L.       Steroid administration will be facilitated using standardized computerized physician order       entry. The patients, treating physicians and outcome assessors will be blinded to the group       assignment. Steroid order sets will include 6 hourly point of care glucose monitoring, and an       insulin sliding scale for glucose levels to facilitate glucose management. The need for       insulin drip will be determined by the treating physician. Additional testing including serum       and urine ketones will be informed by the glucose level, serum anion gap and bicarbonate       levels in routine basic metabolic panels and determined by the treating physician.       In the usual care arm, patients will receive daily CRP measurements for the first 5 days of       the hospitalization, or until hospital discharge.     ","       In community acquired pneumonia, corticosteroids have been shown to have potential benefit.       However, the limited and variable use of adjunctive corticosteroids in critically ill       patients is largely due to an inability to identify patients that will benefit from the use       of anti-inflammatory medications. This study compares usual care to a novel       biomarker-tailored steroid dosing algorithm for patients with community acquired pneumonia.       In April 2020, in response to the SARS CoV-2 pandemic, we added a COVID-19 arm to this study.       The study will evaluate the role of biomarker-titrated adjuvant corticosteroid administration       compared to usual care in patients admitted to hospital with SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection       and acute respiratory failure.

When a person is vaccinated, a coordinated response results: activation and       interaction of distinct innate and adaptive immune cell populations and pathways, culminating       in the formation of germinal centers from which antibody-producing plasma cells and memory B       cells derive. By taking measurements at various time points before and after vaccination, we       can build a comprehensive picture of how the immune system responds to a vaccine challenge.       The seasonal influenza vaccination provides an excellent model of coordinated immune activity       involving innate and adaptive responses, as demonstrated in a past NIH study in 2009-2011;       however, scientific advances and the possibility of multi-season responses in individuals       warrant a new follow-up study with more comprehensive sampling. This is an open-label,       prospective, exploratory study to assess the baseline and post-vaccination immune responses       of healthy volunteers to an approved seasonal influenza vaccine. Subjects will undergo       baseline blood collections on day -7 and on day 0 before receiving the study vaccine. After       vaccination, blood will be collected on days 1, 7, 14, 28, 70, and 100. Optionally, subjects       may also give blood once a month, as requested, up until 1 year after vaccination. Blood       samples will be used to assess short- and long-term immunological effects of immunization.       Evaluations will include vaccine antibody titers. Additional evaluations may include       peripheral immune cell phenotyping, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of whole blood and defined       peripheral blood cell subsets, and measurement of serum proteins and antibodies. Subjects may       optionally provide stool samples at some visits for exploratory microbiome assessment.       Additionally, subjects may optionally continue study participation annually through the       2023-24 influenza season.       The goal of this protocol is to use the collective information gathered across all healthy       volunteers to understand how the immune system works as a whole.     ","       Background:       Vaccines help prevent disease by causing the body to have an immune response. Many parts of       this response happen in the blood. This response happens over days and weeks after getting       the vaccine. Researchers want to how the blood changes over time in response to vaccines.       They want to find out why vaccines work better for some people than for others. This could       help make more effective vaccines.       Objective:       To learn about how the body responds to vaccines.       Eligibility:       Healthy people ages 18 and older       Design:       Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine       tests.       Participants will have 9 visits over 6 months. All visits will include blood tests and a       physical exam.       Participants will have the first visit 1 week before they get the vaccine.       Participants will get the flu vaccine at the second visit. The vaccine will be injected into       the muscle of the upper arm with a needle. They will be watched for side effects for 15       minutes.       Participants will have the next 2 visits exactly 1 day and 1 week after they get the vaccine.       They will have the other 5 visits about 14, 28, 70, and 100 days after they get the vaccine.       Participants will take email questionnaires about whether they had any side effects.       Participants may have optional extra study visits. These will be no more than once a month       for up to 1 year after they get the vaccine.

The original implementation of medical cannabis in the USA was implemented in California as a       compassionate measure to treat the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Additional studies have shown promising       outcome for patients with multiple sclerosis, seizures, cancer, and other chronic conditions.       However, there have been few comprehensive studies that have actually measured whether       cannabis is an effective treatment for pain reduction. There is an absence of multistate,       multicenter clinical studies with cannabis as medicine, not only in the USA but globally.       With the expansion of medical cannabis into more than 38 states in the US, this type of       clinical study is now feasible.       On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization formally characterized coronavirus,       COVID-19, as a global pandemic and health systems globally are continuing their efforts to       manage the outbreak. Coronavirus disease COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly       discovered coronavirus. With the rapidly growing pandemic of COVID-19 caused by the new and       challenging to treat zoonotic SARS-CoV2 coronavirus, there is an urgent need for new       therapies and prevention strategies that can help curtail disease spread and reduce       mortality. Inhibition of viral entry and thereby spread constitute plausible therapeutic       avenues.       This study will utilize an anonymous novel online questionnaire to determine study       participants'' qualifying condition(s) for medical cannabis use, cannabis ingestion method,       frequency of use, prescription drug use, and demographic information. Secondary factors will       include evaluation of pain control, quality of life metrics, any adverse side effects from       cannabis use, as well as changes in adjunctive treatments. Patients will be given medical       cannabis recommendations and certifications commensurate with the state law in which the       encounter occurs. The variations in mechanisms between the states for recommending,       registering, certifying, and developing mandated treatment plans or doses will be adhered to;       however, variations in state law and cannabis programs should not cause variation in the       study design because the end-result is still the same with patients being treated with       medical cannabis.     ","       This will be a multistate, multicenter clinical study to determine the efficacy and safety of       medical cannabis for a wide variety of chronic medical conditions.     ","The primary objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of medical cannabis as medicine for treatment of chronic pain and other chronic debilitating diseases. Pain will be measured by Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) numeric scale. Change from baseline in BPI will be assessed at 3-month intervals.

Previous       pandemics and more localized outbreaks of respiratory emerging infections have resulted in       severe CAP and ICU admission.       Previous pandemics and outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases have outlined the urgent       need for evidence, preferably from Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), to guide best       treatment. However, there are substantial challenges associated with being able to organize       such trials when the time of onset of a pandemic and its exact nature are unpredictable. As       an adaptive platform trial that enrolls patients during the interpandemic period, REMAP-CAP       is ideally positioned to adapt, in the event of a respiratory pandemic, to evaluate existing       treatments as well as novel approaches.     ","       REMAP-CAP is a randomised, embedded, multifactorial, adaptive platform trial for       community-acquired pneumonia.       The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a range of interventions to improve       outcome of patients admitted to intensive care with community-acquired pneumonia.       In addition, REMAP-CAP provides and adaptive research platform for evaluation of multiple       treatment modalities in the event of a respiratory pandemic resulting in critical illness.       REMAP-COVID is a sub-platform of REMAP-CAP that evaluates treatments specific to COVID-19.
